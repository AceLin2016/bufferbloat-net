35,cerowrt,Codel on Cerowrt-3.3.6-2,"A preliminary test release of CeroWrt is now available that has support for Kathie Nichols' and Van Jacobson's new AQM, codel, and Eric Dumazet's fq_codel.","A test release of CeroWrt is now available that has support for Kathie Nichols' and Van Jacobson's new AQM, ""Codel"":http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/ , and Eric Dumazet's new fair queuing implementation on top of that, fq_codel.

fq_codel is enabled on all interfaces by default. It is vastly simpler than what we were using before (sfqred) and draws upon and improves on the same body of ideas (head drop, fq, timestamping) but now tied to Kathie and Van's blinding insights as to a good drop strategy, and Eric's successor ideas as towards head of queue behavior and cache line optimizations.

There is a simple_qos.sh script that can be set to your uplink and downlink speeds, but no uci interface for it as yet, nor gui. (help on finishing aqm-scripts and the luci interface gladly accepted)

To see all the chocolately goodness of what fq_codel can do to wired and wireless latency, it would be good for more to play with it.

Benchmarks have been very good thus far, and more benchmarks and analysis are highly desired.

Caveat:

This release suffers from an unrelated bug ( #379 ) and should NOT be installed as your main router. I would love to beat this bug because it's the only prio 1 remaining but thus far, no luck. Under lighter loads CeroWrt appears to work just fine, but that's for me. YMMV.

50,cerowrt,Heartbleed and CeroWrt - upgrade please!,"Heartbleed was bad, and CeroWrt was somewhat vulnerable - fixes are now available.","Heartbleed Update

In response to the heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160) vulnerability, on April
9th 2014 we updated the under-development CeroWrt release to include
the fixed version of openssl. The fix is in CeroWrt 3.10.36-3 and
later.

We have no means of fixing the ""stable"" (3.7.5) release of CeroWrt,
nor any of the innumerable development releases since then.

Please do a clean, fresh upgrade to CeroWrt 3.10.36-6 or later. [1]
Images are available in: http://snapon.lab.bufferbloat.net/~cero2/cerowrt/wndr/
Reflashing instructions are here:

https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/Cerowrt_flashing_instructions

In the base image, the administration gui of recent CeroWrt versions
depended on openssl (however it is protected by firewall rules to only
be accessible from within your own network), and several optional packages
did also - stunnel - used for ""secure"" tunneling, and openvpn in particular.

To find out more about the bug go to http://heartbleed.com/ and/or
see the relevant page on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed

Heartbleed is one of the most serious bugs that has ever hit the
internet, and in addition to web services, critical network daemons
such as those that manage network printing, logging, monitoring, voip,
chat, tunnels, vpns and email, all can potentially be exploited.

We strongly advise resyncing your source trees with us and distributing
new firmware images containing the updated libraries. All
network facing TLS-using daemons are potentially a risk, as are
any TLS using services exposed behind the firewall. 

Once your system is secured again, you should re-issue certs and passwords,
as per: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/bleeding-hearts-club-heartbleed-recovery-system-administrators
and check for unverified commits.

Packages maintained in the openwrt core repositories that can be
affected when compiled for openssl[2] may include: libevent2,
ustream-ssl, hostapd, openvpn, authsae, luci-ssl, and uhttpd.

Optional network daemons in other repositories such as radsecproxy,
vsftpd, squid, mini_httpd, pure-ftpd, cups, ndyndns, elinks,
libtorrent, monit, nagios, syslog-ng3, boxbackup, rsyncrypto, curl,
cyrus-sasl, openldap, icecast, fetchmail, dovecot, transmission,
stunnel, httptunnel, apache, lighttpd, znc, net-snmp, bitlbee,
asterisk, postfix and openvpn *all* use TLS level security, are
often linked against openssl, and are thus potentially vulnerable.

Please see the relevant website for each of the products above
for news on their vulnerabilities. Much of the furor over heartbleed
has focused on websites, where notably smtp and imaps and im traffic
has also been shown vulnerable.

https://zmap.io/heartbleed/

http://blog.freenode.net/2014/04/heartbleed/

Other infrastructure, router and CPE distributions are also affected.

Two examples among many:

http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/16/bt-heartbleed-home-hubs

http://www.cnet.com/news/heartbleed-bug-also-affects-cisco-juniper-equipment/

Network facing Applications built on top of php4, php5, python, luasec, erlang, ruby
are also potentially affected.

Packages maintained in the ceropackages repository that were potentially
vulnerable are xorp, python-lafs, ccnx, and resiprocate.

Please take this seriously and check your firmware and your products for
usage of the vulnerable openssl versions.

We note also that multiple other serious vulnerabilities have been
fixed in other CeroWrt and OpenWrt packages and in the Linux kernel over
the past years; you should consider fixing those vulnerabilities in
your downstream products and routers while you are at it.

We have long been supportive of adding new features for openwrt to
make it more easily updated in the field, the work could use more
eyeballs and developers, and we need to find resources and funding for
a code audit in the coming months.

Notes:

[1] Regrettably in the present development branch (3.10.36-4) we are
trying to isolate a wifi bug that crops up after much traffic, we will
announce a fix for that when it arrives. See Bug #442 .

[2] The base as-provided-by OpenWrt base binary installations are not
vulnerable to HeartBleed, as neither the builtin SSH server nor the
optional LuCI SSL support rely on OpenSSL for cryptographic TLS
support. Their Attitude Adjustment release used cyassl as a base,
and the underway Barrier Breaker development series uses PolarSSL
for as many packages as support exists and the GPLv2 license allows.

In other words the OpenSSL library is not installed within the stock
base images available on their download servers, however they too
contain many optional packages that do depend on openssl to function,
and many downstream products may have chosen openssl over those 
products.

Check your trees! And if you are having a bad week, perhaps this
will help: http://www.taht.net/~mtaht/uncle_bills_helicopter.html

23,bloat,Bufferbloat demo videos,Bufferbloat demo videos are available.,"If people have heard of bufferbloat at all, it is usually just an abstraction despite having personal experience with it. Bufferbloat can occur in your operating system, your home router, your broadband gear, wireless, and almost anywhere in the Internet.  They still think that if they experience poor Internet speed means they must need more bandwidth, and take vast speed variation for granted. Sometimes, adding bandwidth can actually hurt rather than help. Most people have no idea what they can do about bufferbloat.

So I’ve been working to put together several demos to help make bufferbloat concrete, and demonstrate at least partial mitigation. The mitigation shown may or may not work in your home router, and you need to be able to set both upload and download bandwidth.

Two  of four cases we commonly all suffer from at home are:
# Broadband bufferbloat (upstream)
# Home router bufferbloat (downstream)
Rather than attempt to show worst case bufferbloat which can easily induce complete failure, I decided to demonstrate these two cases of “typical” bufferbloat as shown by the ICSI data. As the bufferbloat varies widely as the ICSI data shows, your mileage will also vary widely.

There are two versions of the video:

# ""A short bufferbloat video"":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npiG7EBzHOU, of slightly over 8 minutes, which includes both demonstrations, but elides most of the explanation. It’s intent is to get people “hooked” so they will want to know more.
# ""The longer version of the video"":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D-cJNtKwuw clocks in at 21 minutes, includes both demonstrations, but gives a simplified explanation of bufferbloat’s cause, to encourage people to dig yet further.",2012-02-01 10:24:02.131949,Jim Gettys

h2. About Freeswitch[1]

""FreeSWITCH"":http://www.freeswitch.org is a scalable, open source, cross-platform soft-switch that allows for consolidating various forms of communication media. It is used primarily for telephony applications - VoIP and traditional PSTN - but also supports video, chat, and other forms of communication.

FreeSWITCH was created in 2006 in response to the need for an open source, freely available telephony platform that could fill the void left by proprietary commercial offerings. Anthony Minessale is the chief architect and lead programmer on the FreeSWITCH project. He is joined by two veteran developers - Brian K West and Michael Jerris. All three of these experienced engineers spent a number of years developing for the Asterisk PBX project before starting FreeSWITCH. 

FreeSWITCH was designed with the goals of modularity, stability, and scalability. It is now used in thousands of servers to power VoIP communications for business and organizations around the world, and runs on nearly every operating system.

h2. About the Bufferbloat project

If you are not already aware of what bufferbloat is, the fastest way to get up to speed is to peruse the slides and listen to 25 minutes of audio before the conference call, at:

http://mirrors.bufferbloat.net/Talks/BellLabs01192011/

It would be great to have an informed audience so we can only touch lightly on the preliminaries and then dive deeper into bufferbloat and VOIP issues. See also Jim Gettys' blog postings[2], discussions on lwn.net[3], and slashdot[4], and elsewhere[5], as well as two very busy mailing lists[6]

In short, the bufferbloat problem is that there are really big, bloated network buffers in many (especially new) routers, home (mostly wireless) gateways, hosts, and ADSL/FIOS/cable modems that can dramatically affect VOIP performance.

The bufferbloat project[7] is attempting to identify equipment and software where truly bloated buffers exist, and mitigate or fix the issues with new software algorithms and heightened awareness. Recently we've released a debloat-testing Linux kernel[8] that may help in some cases. Bufferbloat is not a Linux-specific problem, it exists in all OSes, and may become more acute as Windows 7 gets rolled out.

58,cerowrt,Press Release-Experts' Comments to FCC re: Wi-Fi Routers,"Over 250 internet experts filed comments to FCC Docket ET 15-170 regarding firmware for Wi-Fi Routers.
","_October 14, 2015 06:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time_

_WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--_ In a ""letter submitted to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC),"":http://huchra.bufferbloat.net/~d/fcc_saner_software_practices.pdf Dave Täht, co-founder of the ""Bufferbloat Project"":http://bufferbloat.net, and Dr. Vinton Cerf, co-inventor of the Internet, along with more than 260 other global network and cybersecurity experts, responded to the newly proposed FCC rules laid out in ""ET Docket No. 15-170"":https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-15-92A1.pdf for RF Devices such as Wi-Fi routers by unveiling a new approach to improve the security of these devices and ensure a faster, better, and more secure Internet.

The letter was filed during the agency’s public comment period on this issue.

Dave Farber, former Chief Technologist of the FCC, supports the new approach, stating, “Today there are hundreds of millions of Wi-Fi routers in homes and offices around the globe with severe software flaws that can be easily exploited by criminals. While we agree with the FCC that the rules governing these devices must be updated, we believe the proposed rules laid out by the agency lack critical accountability for the device manufacturers.”

“We can't afford to let any part of the Internet's infrastructure rot in place. We made this proposal because the wireless spectrum must not only be allocated responsibly, but also used responsibly. By requiring a bare minimum of openness in the technology at the edge of the Internet, we'll ensure that any mistakes or cheating are caught early and fixed fast,” said Dr. Vint Cerf, a co-inventor of the Internet and also Senior Vice President and Chief Internet Evangelist at Google.

To improve accountability significantly while keeping the original intent of the regulation, the signatories, who also included Dr. Paul Vixie, Dr. Sascha Meinrath, Dr. Nick Feamster, Jim Gettys, Dr. David P. Reed, Dr. Andreas Petlund, Jeff Osborn, and other well-known industry experts, recommend the FCC mandate the following actions:

# Any vendor of software-defined radio (SDR), wireless, or Wi-Fi radio must make public the full and maintained source code for the device driver and radio firmware in order to maintain FCC compliance. The source code should be in a buildable, change-controlled source code repository on the Internet, available for review and improvement by all.
# The vendor must assure that secure update of firmware be working at time of shipment, and that update streams be under ultimate control of the owner of the equipment. Problems with compliance can then be fixed going forward by the person legally responsible for the router being in compliance.
# The vendor must supply a continuous stream of source and binary updates that must respond to regulatory transgressions and Common Vulnerability and Exposure reports (CVEs) within 45 days of disclosure, for the warranted lifetime of the product, or until five years after the last customer shipment, whichever is longer.
# Failure to comply with these regulations should result in FCC decertification of the existing product and, in severe cases, bar new products from that vendor from being considered for certification.
# Additionally, we ask the FCC to review and rescind any rules for anything that conflicts with open source best practices, produce unmaintainable hardware, or cause vendors to believe they must only ship undocumented “binary blobs” of compiled code or use lockdown mechanisms that forbid user patching. This is an ongoing problem for the Internet community committed to best practice change control and error correction on safety-critical systems.

For the complete letter and the full list of supporters, please ""visit here."":http://huchra.bufferbloat.net/~d/fcc_saner_software_practices.pdf

“Our fight for a free and open Internet began long before the invention and wide use of Wi-Fi home routers, whose manufacturers chose to base on open software. We are at an important inflection point in the history of the Internet. The FCC has an opportunity to take positive action that will increase the security and performance not only of these devices, but also influence how manufacturers develop secure Internet of Things while preserving an open Internet,” said Jim Gettys, Chairman, Bufferbloat Project.

“Networking research and innovation fundamentally depend on the ability to modify firmware on CPE and deploy it in real-world settings in home networks,” said Dr. Nick Feamster, Acting Director of Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University.

""The Internet is now effectively a battleground with end-users, our employers, our schools and our vendors on one side, and organized crime and nation-states on the other side. Our home gateways are often repurposed by our adversaries into weapons against us because these small, cheap plastic boxes are unpatchable, abandoned by their makers, and completely opaque. These devices are currently the Internet's public enemy #1. The plan proposed would significantly decontaminate our technology supply chain,” said Dr. Paul Vixie, CEO of Farsight Security, Inc.

“The recommendations in this document would go a long way toward ensuring the existence of a highly performant, secure, and regulation-compliant Internet far into the future,” said Jonathan Corbet, Executive Editor, LWN.net.

“As the recent revelations about the ‘Moon Worm,’ ‘DNSchanger,’ and ‘Misfortune Cookie’ and now the Volkswagen scandal illustrate, secret, locked-down firmware represents a clear and present danger to the security of the Internet,” said Ted Lemon, recent Area Director at the IETF.

“If we raise the bar for firmware code quality, maintenance, and upgrades, we can finish beating bufferbloat, especially on Wi-Fi, deploy IPv6 faster, improve security, and build a vastly better Internet, for everybody,” said Dave Täht, Architect, CeroWrt, co-founder, Bufferbloat Project.

12,bloat,6 weeks of backlogged news,"I've been too busy to write up what's been going on, here's a summary of goings on with Georgia Tech, uberwrt, debloating patches, and more:","I'd intended to write up summaries of bufferbloat related activity once a month, but am running a bit behind. Both JG and I have been travelling heavily.

There's been a lot going on under the covers!

Probably the biggest news is that we are working with Georgia Tech on their bismark project.[1] They are out to diagnoise the Internet and we are out to fix it. The two goals seemed compatible. In particular: we are trying to de-""heisenbug"" the test routers so they can accurately test the upstream services.

We've also taken the wraps off the ""uberwrt"" project[2], which is an attempt to get the debloating work TESTED in realistic situations at the edge and also into openwrt. (Some work from this also flows into bismark)

I was going to write formal joint press releases on these but have been too busy traveling, talking and hacking. (if anyone wants to step up to handle PR?)

Although traffic on the bloat mailing list has been slow of late, the bismark-devel list has been hopping. Feel free to join bismark/uberwrt projects and/or the mailing list[3], especially if you are interested in embedded hardware.

Moving on to other topics...

Based on the early difficulties in getting debloat-testing to be a useful base for the eBDP and A* algorithms, we started looking around for ONE driver to work with and have settled on ath9k hardware (for now) as a base for routers and wireless cards. [10] We need to do a little testing of the laptop cards, but things are looking good.  the WNDR3700v2 is AWESOME, actually. 16MB of flash. LUXURY.

Other Patches:

Dan Siemon's pfifo_fast fix for ECN has been backported into 2.6.37.X for openwrt's git head as of Saturday. It's also now part of 2.6.39 and 2.6.38 stable.

SFB is in mainline Linux 2.6.39-RCX and woefully undertested in its current incarnation.

Felix Feitkeu has some patches more fully instrumenting the ath9k driver (when mildly more complete, these should get slammed into debloat-testing as well) [4]

Dan Siemon has improved both his TC shaper test scripts and ping-exp [5]

Media: There were a couple articles on bufferbloat that went by this month, I think they were all covered on this list...

There are 236 members of the bloat list now.

Infrastructure:

We are moving a ton of work to a new build server and also moving the lists machine to that. Regrettably as I write, ""huchra"" is down due to finger-foo. It should be back up again Monday.

Multiple other servers in other locations are in the queue. I hope to get that sorted out with isc while I am in California.

Upcoming Travel:

JG will be in California April 25-30. I will also be in California April 25-30 (in at least one of the same places as JG), and am available for additional talks/coding/consulting/etc along the western seaboard in early May if anyone wants me and can cover my expenses. (Sort of scheduled: Byte and Atheros U) I'll also be visiting Seattle at some point in May, too.

Travel last month:

JG spent spent several weeks in Europe, first attending the Wireless BattleMesh conference[6], then the IETF, giving a shorter version of his bufferbloat talk[7].

I spent a week in florida gathering strength for my world tour. Then I spent a week with Georgia Tech helping get their Bismark project off the ground and hammering out workflow issues.

I was tickled pink when I gave an introductory talk on bufferbloat to a class there, only to discover when Q&A rolled around that everyone participating was *already* up to speed on bufferbloat and queueing disciplines, and peppered me with questions on SFB, RED, eBDP and other algorithms we are playing with. 3 months ago I would have been met with blank looks, now it's a struggle to keep up!

I then spent a week with esr getting one of the first near-complete builds of the wndr3700 working well, working on gpsd (wanted accurate time on openwrt) and rsnapshot and split dns and a host of semi-bufferbloat.net-and-uberwrt issues... And we also got a revised version of the intro to bufferbloat document up on the wiki [8].

I'm very happy to see thyrsus.com go ipv6 enabled.

The bufferbloat wiki is still in dire need of love, see the Todo list for more details [9] -

Conclusion:

And that's all the news I can remember this late Sunday evening. It's my hope that SFB will make it into bismark/uberwrt this week so we can test SFB a little more while it is still a RC in 2.6.39. I'd VERY MUCH like to make sure SFB works when it is released to millions of users worldwide. That will be in 4 weeks or so... I'm feeling a little schedule pressure here...

53,cerowrt,CeroWrt 3.10.50-1 -- Declaring Victory,CeroWrt 3.10.50-1 has been delightfully stable - uptimes of >80 days are common. ,"We are extremely pleased to report that CeroWrt has been highly stable since it was built over six months ago. We recently surveyed our user base, and uptimes are terrific - ranging as high as 124 days, with a lion's share of the reports greater than 80 days. Most of the reasons for reboots are due to things like power failures. CeroWrt is meeting its design goals: 
* Reliable, secure, high performance home router
* Bufferbloat has been controlled with fq_codel and the sqm-scripts
* IPv6 just works, either from a native provider, such as Comcast, or through a tunnel such as Hurricane Electric
* DNSSEC just works
* We've proved the value of routing different interfaces, instead of bridging together the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and Ethernet interfaces
* And lots more

The latest CeroWrt 3.10.50-1 was resync'd with the OpenWrt sources on 28 July 2014. Therefore, the CeroWrt builds have ceased to change from that date. You can review the build history from the CeroWrt release notes at: http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/CeroWrt_310_Release_Notes

That said, there are a few important efforts to take into account:

# We have aggressively pushed the interesting changes back into the OpenWrt mainline. All these changes are now available through the standard OpenWrt builds.
# CeroWrt development is dormant at the moment as we begin to think about the next step - how to ""make wi-fi fast"". (There are a number of bad behaviors in most wi-fi drivers that lower your wi-fi performance far below what is theoretically possible. We want to fix this.)
# OpenWrt has declared victory on their ""Barrier Breaker"" (BB) firmware evolution based on a Linux 3.10 kernel. They are now pursuing their ""Chaos Calmer"" (CC) build based on 3.18 (or later) kernel. CC will have all the goodness of BB, plus the new features they're planning.

Advice:

* If you already own a Netgear WNDR 3800 (or 3700v2), you certainly won't go wrong with the CeroWrt 3.10.50-1 build. But don't run out and buy one today - they're becoming scarce and expensive. 
* If you're looking for stable, well-supported router firmware for your home, consider the OpenWrt BB build. It's available for a wide variety of routers, and incorporates most of the major capabilities that we put into CeroWrt. 
* If you're willing to put up with a little testing, check out the OpenWrt CC builds. That software is undergoing constant development, tweaks, and enhancements, and contains all the goodness of CeroWrt.
* If you really want to live on the bleeding edge, join the CeroWrt Developer's list https://lists.bufferbloat.net/listinfo/cerowrt-devel to keep an eye on (or help with!) developments here. In a few months, we're planning to do more work on wi-fi, potentially on new, more available, higher performance hardware.

I'd prefer to test 24 hours but I'm about to start a trip and can't do that. Hopefully after some more testers leap on it we can declare it stable later this week and move on...

Also the source tree is mostly pushed out but a bit of a mess, I don't know if I'll be able to get Cero independently buildable before late next week.

+ memory problem with ath9k appears gone
+ ECN dropping instituted under load

+ There is now 6rd support, totally untested and unconfigured;
+ transmission bittorrent is in there, too
+ fq_codel on all interfaces by default, on wireless using all 4 subqueues


-s on this release: I went for ""stable"" rather than new features after it cost me too much time.

- I had to rip out opkg signing support, and some ipv6/diffserv classification support in transmission that wasn't fully baked.

- re-running simple_qos.sh with new values appears to require a reboot first

-The default gui for AQM doesn't work, the one for ""qos"" uses hfsc + fq_codel (but lacks ipv6 and diffserv support), and the command line simple_qos.sh has ipv6 and diffserv, but has to be edited and run manually. And perhaps it's use of htb etc can be improved. I get pretty good results on comcast with simple_qos, see speedtest results here:

 http://pastebin.com/Fq6G5Q4u

but not *quite* as good as I hoped for. However, under heavier loads the fq_codel stuff is working great under netperf with various numbers of threads and classifications and users.

I would hope some folk here run some benchmarks against various things but some cautions - for example - chrome's benchmark tends to hit dns
hard, and cero by default is not using your most local forwarder so it can bottleneck on dns - ways to fix that if you have dnssec is to edit
forwarders.conf to point to your local forwarder, and uncomment the forwarders line in named.conf. If your ISP doesn't
do dnssec yet, disable dnssec and point forwarders.conf to their nameservers - but I otherwise am getting good results.

Also: I would really prefer people clearly identify when they are testing over wireless vs ethernet and until you have a fq_codel and
debloat-script enabled kernel on your laptop, too, I am finding most of the time the bloat is coming from the testing box rather than cerowrt
itself!

There are now fq_codel enabled kernels for ubuntu 12.4 and fedora 16 available here:

http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki

I look forward to analyzing htb vs hfsc and further tuning of qos-scripts and the simple_qos script. I'm too stupid apparently to
come up with a way to run simple_qos out of the aqm gui... (help wanted)

The new version of quagga-babeld is available in the opkg repository and it has been confirmed to work right with ipv4 mesh interfaces. I
am really looking forward to people trying this and the authentication code now in quagga so we can migrate off of the existing babeld.

54,cerowrt,CeroWrt Triumphs over Bufferbloat,The fq_codel algorithm which received major testing in the CeroWrt router firmware has been shown to virtually eliminate bufferbloat.,"The CeroWrt project, and its implementation of fq_codel as seen in the current build of the firmware, eliminates the problem of bufferbloat. These changes have been pushed into Linux kernel and the OpenWrt mainline (""Barrier Breaker"" release), and are now widely available.

Bufferbloat is the undesirable latency that comes from a router or other network equipment buffering too much data. It has plagued network routers from the early days. The problem was made worse as RAM became cheaper: network engineers worried that dropping packets would make the network slow, so there was an incentive to buffer more and more packets. This had the paradoxical effect of retaining too many packets, which hold up all the traffic behind those buffers.

Many efforts through the 1990s and 2000's attempted to address the problem. Random Early Drop (RED) and its variants showed promise, but didn't monitor the proper variables, and were thus hard to configure properly and would hurt performance if not tuned correctly. Various quality of service (QoS) policies can give priority to certain types of traffic, but they're hard to configure. As traffic types change and evolve, these policies become a maintenance hassle, since they need to be rewritten on a regular basis.

In early 2012, Kathie Nichols took another look at the problem of overbuffered routers and designed the CoDel (pronounced ""coddle') algorithm. The major insight was that the best way to avoid ""too much buffering"" was to monitor a packet's _sojourn time_ - the time elapsed between when it was queued for transmssion and dequeued. If that time exceeds a certain threshold (generally 5 msec), it indicated that the packet had been queued for a long time. CoDel would then drop a percentage of those packet to provide feedback to the sender that it was using more than its share of the available capacity. An elaboration to the CoDel algorithm - fq_codel from Eric Dumazet - placed packets for each source/destination flow in a separate queue, and applied the CoDel algorithm to each queue to extremely good effect.

The resulting fq_codel qdisc was put in to the Linux 3.5 kernel in July 2012. ",2015-03-10 07:47:37.296357,Rich Brown
38,codel,Codel (coddling) in the news,"A great deal of coverage of codel is now out there, and some reactions to fq_codel - and it's all good. I keep waiting for another shoe to drop, but so far, so good.","Kamal Mostafa built an ""Ubuntu 12.4 PPA"":https://launchpad.net/~kamalmostafa/+archive/bufferbloat, and wrote: ""The result is *very* impressive: I see a 30X reduction in ping latency on a fully saturated 10Mbps network, just by switching on the new fq_codel scheduler. For an interactive ssh session over that same saturated 10Mbps network, fq_codel totally eliminates the laggy keyboard response — it feels like there’s no other network traffic at all!""

Steve Gibson, on ""Steve Gibson's Security Now podcast"":http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-359.htm said:

""They show charts where they show the throughput under these varying conditions, even though they're  discarding intelligently, and it's right up between 90 and 100 percent;  whereas the traditional algorithms collapse down into the low 10s of  percent of overall throughput.  It's just - it's fantastic. ""

I'm not going to let this last bit of exuberance get to me - as I remember how Tesla ended up, after suffering through decades of patent battles.

I froze cerowrt on march 14th, got a little distracted by a demo of static deterministic nat and the port control protocol (PCP) as part of the on-going ietf meeting, and fell behind on keeping up on patches to openwrt.

When I got caught up today, patches had landed which touched every major subsystem in cerowrt - the ethernet driver, the wireless driver, the kernel, scripting and the gui. Enough broke in the last two weeks of me not paying attention to the continuous integration process to make going forwards or backwards very difficult. Right now, most noticeable, wifi doesn't come up by default.

I am pleased to say that dnsmasq has made great progress in AAAA dns integration, that iptables and iproute 3.3 have landed, and that I think I've made a dent in bug #113 (dnssec), but there's enough broken thus far to force me to pull all the 3.3.0 related releases until some of the stuff flying in loose formation congeals into one piece. That may not be until 3.3.1 is released. 

Also making a bit of progress on dhcp-dp, I think.

Hopefully early next week I'll have the pieces pulled together again to where new builds of cerowrt are useable, rather than merely debuggable. And the sources are as available as possible, on github,if you want to chip in. There's plenty of bugs left to fix...

Documentation, flash images, and installation guide are at:

http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/OCEAN_CITY_INSTALLATION_GUIDE

This smoke test release is only for the brave... of whom I hope there are many on these lists.

I hope to put out one release candidate per week for the next month, until this is baked enough to freeze for a while.

The existing bug/feature database is out of date, I'll be updating that soon, but as this is hopefully baked enough for others than myself, jg, esr, and evan hunt to be be using, I'd love it if more people could get one of these routers and try out this code.

What the heck is CeroWrt?

Cerowrt is the outgrowth of trying to de-heisenbug debloat-testing. The results we were getting on conventional boxes were not repeatable on conventional routers, until now. The project gradually grew from OpenWrt into a kitchen sink worth of useful network analysis stuff from other projects until it became... CeroWrt. Much of it has been pushed back into openwrt...

To quote from it's integral help screen:

CeroWrt is an OpenWrt router platform for use by individuals, researchers, and students interested in advancing the state of the art on the Internet. Specifically, it is aimed at investigating the problems of latency under load, bufferbloat, wireless-n, QoS, and the effects of various TCP algorithms on shared networks. The features of this release include:

* linux 2.6.39.2 with a few bloat-related patches
* Bind9 DNS services with DNSSEC
* extensive network diagnostic, performance measurement, and simulation tools
* support for TCP bic, cubic, westwood, and reno
* comprehensive IPv6 support
* integral web and rsync servers
* support for mesh networking
* a web proxy server

and most importantly, extensive debloating throughout the stack.

Then I tripped over an obscure portion of the Amazon EULA, and ended up refunding everyone's money and cancelling your subscriptions.

So, I've put up a new subscribe/donations page for the cerowrt portion of the project, using paypal at:

http://www.teklibre.com/cerowrt/subscribe.html

I won't jimmy wales you'all on further solicitations like this. (I know, that's what I said last month) 

But a little more help in getting over this hump would be very nice to have.

56,cerowrt,Supplemental Quotes to the FCC Letter,Additional quotes that couldn't be included in the Press Release.,"“Wi-Fi devices aren’t just radios: they are network devices.  The software that governs them impacts the security and reliability of the whole network. If we leave firmware solely in the hands of manufacturers, we close the door to the very independent research that has been advancing the state of Internet technology and security all along.”  -- _Susan E. Sons, Director, Internet Civil Engineering Institute_ 

""The security implications should be obvious to anyone who's been paying attention to recent headlines.  Less obvious is all the research and other work that goes on behind the scenes, by the very people who made the Internet what it is today.  Losing the ability to control the software that runs on these devices would bring this kind of research to a halt, and tie the hands of many brilliant minds who have dedicated their lives and careers to the continued improvement of the network we all depend on.  If we want to build the fast, secure, reliable Internet of the future, this kind of research must be allowed to continue."" -- _Jeff Loughlin, Independent Researcher and Open Source Developer_

""Leveraging off-the-shelf WiFi hardware plays an important role in academic research in the field. Locked down devices would both independent verification of vendor performance claims and research into improving performance of current and future generation WiFi."" -- _Toke Høiland-Jørgensen, Bufferbloat researcher at Karlstad University, Sweden_

“Dyn provides performance solutions for a significant proportion of the world's most popular web properties, and invests significant resources in maintaining the availability of our global DNS platform in the face of near constant attack. Low-cost (near zero-margin) home and small-business routers, easily compromised, are a significant contributor to attack traffic that we mitigate every day. In the race to the bottom, these devices are effectively unsupported by those who sell them; the ability to harden such devices is essential to the future success of the Internet as a reliable platform for communication and commerce.” -- _Joe Abley, Director of Architecture, Dyn_

“Software upgradeability and inspection is vitally important, and should not be impaired. It is unimaginable that the FCC would propose anything to impede updates to network elements, and I hope that the words in the petition are considered carefully and used as a template for sane (and light) legislation.” -- _John Todd, Senior Technologist at Packet Clearing House_

“As the editor of the IETF standards document RFC 7368 “IPv6 Home Networking Architecture Principles”, which describes how future IPv6 home networks can be built, I fully support the Letter submitted to the FCC,. The IETF works on the principle of rough consensus and running code, and the ability to modify and update open source home router images enables innovation and the future advancement of the Internet” -- _Dr Tim Chown, Lecturer, University of Southampton (UK)_

“While looking at regulation, it would be more useful to consider ensuring vendors adopt IPv6 as they have ignored it for the last 10+ years requiring a complete device replacement. FOSS has enabled many of their devices to be updated rather than dumped in landfill.” -- _Brandon Butterworth, Chief Scientist, British Broadcasting Corporation_

“The Internet of Things shouldn't be the Internet of Vulnerable Unpatchable Abandoned-by-Manufacturer Things.” -- _Will Edwards_

""Unlike global climate change, software is a human construct, conceived by engineers. The use and management of it is therefore modifiable to be optimized for future use by qualified people with predictable positive results for security.  As such, these issues deserve to have sufficient technical resources and intelligent legal framework to make this happen."" -- _Randy Resnick, Creator, IP Communications & VoIP Community and VoIP Users Conference_

“I was one of the designers of the Minstrel rate control algorithm that is now used for many, many Wi-Fi devices. Minstrel approximately doubled the range and gave a 10x improvement in throughput for Wi-Fi devices of the time, at the same time as decreasing their time-average radiated power. That research would have been prohibited or greatly impeded by the proposed rulemaking. It was done outside of the FCC jurisdiction, in New Zealand, but other countries tend to follow the FCC rule structure, and technical measures to implement the proposed FCC rules would be a serious impediment to doing that sort of work irrespective of the legal aspects. Further, this rule would set a precedent that would inevitably be applied in other areas of technology, and this would cause a great deal of harm to research and innovation. Locked-down firmware on Internet-connected devices stands to become a very serious problem for society, and should not be encouraged in any way. I strongly agree with the proposed alternate path for that reason.” -- _Andrew McGregor: Linux WiFi developer (Minstrel rate control), IETF working group chair, AQM developer and SDN researcher_

“""Software by its very nature has bugs and will be vulnerable to attack. The only way we can be confident that such a critical piece of our societal infrastructure is as safe as possible is if the source code is made fully available for review and can be fixed by anyone with authority when problems arise. This alternate proposal, which is grounded in a deep understanding of how security issues really play out in this context, should be seriously considered by the FCC."" -- _Karen M. Sandler, Executive Director, Software Freedom Conservancy_

""We are entering an era where an array of interconnected devices will create 'lowest common denominator security' within the most private reaches of our homes. True cybersecurity results from open code, peer review, and user control over their own devices and data; our recommended solutions are fundamentally important to the future growth of the Internet of Things economy.” -- _Sascha Meinrath, Palmer Chair in Telecommunications at Penn State University_

“With the Internet of Things upon us, regulators can play a vital role in making our hardware secure. By requiring industry-leading engineering practices like we’ve described in this comment, the FCC can ensure Americans have more secure devices which respect the radio spectrum. At the same time, these practices provide makers and inventors with the flexibility necessary for world-leading innovation.” -- _Eric Schultz_",2015-10-14 20:44:58.428544,Rich Brown
