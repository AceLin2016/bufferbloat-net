# Bufferbloat.net web site source

This repo contains an export of the old bufferbloat.net web site,
converted to Hugo and markdown format. So far only the wiki pages are
imported, so things are a bit of a work in progress. Pull requests to
improve things are welcome.

A rendered version of the repo is available at
https://kau.toke.dk/bufferbloat-net as well as at http://www.bufferbloat.net
