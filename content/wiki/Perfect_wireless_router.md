Perfect wireless router
=======================

While we are all geeks here, there are several commercial vendors
struggling with building CPE gear that we might be able to learn from,
notably comcast's struggles with the 160N and e3000, and google's.

But I'd really like a discussion. One existing answer
(<link>wisp6</link>) is pretty radical in scope with special problems.
The <link>Build Configuration</link> describes what we have so far.

This RFC is not bad:
