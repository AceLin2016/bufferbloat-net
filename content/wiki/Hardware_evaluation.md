Hardware evaluation process
===========================

The hardware evaluation process has proceded as more a matter of luck
and available resources than anything else.

There has been no financial involvement by any vendor in any part of the
selections made so far.

The principal factor determining the value of hardware to this project
has been the availability of support in the openwrt mainline and
non-binary blobs used for the wifi drivers. A minimum of 8MB of flash is
required for this project (more would be helpful), as well as a minimum
of 32MB of ram (64MB or more recommended), which also excludes many
off-the-shelf components commonly available on the market today.
