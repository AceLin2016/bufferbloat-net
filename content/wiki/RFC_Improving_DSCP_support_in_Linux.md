RFC: Improving DSCP support in Linux
====================================

{{include(Diffserv Linux Improvement Overview)}}

1.  <link>Basic Diffserv Improvements to Linux</link>
2.  <link>More advanced Diffserv support in Linux</link>
3.  <link>Radical Diffserv improvements</link>
4.  <link>Save\_the\_Mice|Stop shooting system control packets</link>!
5.  <link>Analysis of existing firewalls and shapers</link>

You can also see these suggestions as <link>Diffserv\_RFC|one big web
page</link>.

This is very much a WIP and may at some point evolve into a more formal
RFC and actual code.
