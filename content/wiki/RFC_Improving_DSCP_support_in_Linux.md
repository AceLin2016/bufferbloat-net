RFC: Improving DSCP support in Linux
====================================

{{include(Diffserv Linux Improvement Overview)}}

1.  [Basic Diffserv Improvements to Linux]({{< relref "wiki/Basic_Diffserv_Improvements_to_Linux.md" >}})
2.  [More advanced Diffserv support in Linux]({{< relref "wiki/More_advanced_Diffserv_support_in_Linux.md" >}})
3.  [Radical Diffserv improvements]({{< relref "wiki/Radical_Diffserv_improvements.md" >}})
4.  <link>Save\_the\_Mice|Stop shooting system control packets</link>!
5.  [Analysis of existing firewalls and shapers]({{< relref "wiki/Analysis_of_existing_firewalls_and_shapers.md" >}})

You can also see these suggestions as [one big web page]({{< relref "wiki/Diffserv_RFC.md" >}}).

This is very much a WIP and may at some point evolve into a more formal
RFC and actual code.
