Tips for Contributors
=====================

This project is intended to help codes and other project contributors
get oriented about our project tools and practices.

The Bufferbloat Sites
---------------------

The Bufferbloat sites are hosted on Redmine, a project-hosting engine
that combines an issue tracker with a wiki and other useful features.

Redmine's wiki is not the best wiki in the world, but it's tolerable and
the project group developing it is helpful and constantly improving it.

It also has good access control, and the ability to delegate
administration and even project creation, so no single person has to be
the center of the universe.

Eating our own dogfood
----------------------

We believe in [earing our own dogfood]({{< relref "wiki/Dogfood_Principle.md" >}}).
The bufferbloat servers are tuned and administered using the same
bufferbloat-mitigation techniques we develop for others to use.

IPv6
----

The Bufferbloat project servers are fully IPv6 enabled. Dave Taht
describes the recipe he used [here]({{< relref "wiki/IPv6.md" >}}).
