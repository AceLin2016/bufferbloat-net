Sugarland (CeroWrt 3.3) Builds

Sugarland (CeroWrt 3.3.8-26) was released on 18 Sep 2012, and is the

BQL builds
----------

The bql-smoketest builds provided a good improvement to the buffer bloat
problem from November 2011 through February 2012. However, all their
major improvements have been implemented in the Linux 3.3 kernel. You
can read the <link>BQL series release notes</link>. bql-smoketests:

OCEAN CITY builds
-----------------

About the OCEAN CITY release. In the latter half of 2011, we had hoped
to release a build with grand goals. This release was to be named OCEAN
CITY. But reality set in, and it became obvious that we could not meet
these goals. The rc6 build is the culmination of the Ocean City release.

Any remaining references to an Ocean City on these pages are being
changed to align with the more important goals set out above. The
<link>OCEAN CITY</link> page lists obsolete information.
