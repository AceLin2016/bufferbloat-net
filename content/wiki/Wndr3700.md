Wndr3700 and BISMark
====================

NOTE: Although the wndr3700 works, the [wndr3700v2]({{< relref "wiki/Wndr3700v2.md" >}}) has 16MB
of flash, which is GREAT. The v1 may not be supportable in the near
future.

If you acquire a wndr3700, look [on the side of the box]({{< relref "wiki/Wndr3700v2.md" >}}) to make sure you get a [wndr3700v2]({{< relref "wiki/Wndr3700v2.md" >}}) version.

And then install the v2 squashfs version of the bismark images.

You will need to download the latest [images are
here](http://huchra.bufferbloat.net/~bismark/)

Generic [Installation
instructions](http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700#oem.easy.installation)\
Specific [Flashing instruction for Mac]({{< relref "wiki/Flashing_instruction_for_Mac.md" >}}).

If you need additional packages, you will need to remove /etc/opkg/\*
then edit the /etc/opkg.conf file to point to either
http://huchra.bufferbloat.net/\~bismark/ your\_build instead of what it
points to currently, then do a

`opkg update
  opkg list
  opkg install your_package`

There will be a special <link>bismark feed</link> at some point

Please note that huchra will move to a saner name at some point in the
near future, and we hope to make these defaults somehow.
