Why 42?
=======

42 is is the answer to "life, the universe, and everything". What was
the question, nobody knows. A really, really, really big computer was
built to figure that out, and failed...

42 is also how old I was when I came up with a way to try to change my
life for the better.

42 is also the [babel protocol's magic
number](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-chroboczek-babel-routing-protocol-05)
. I ended up picking 172.30.42.x as the default ip address set for cero,
to add to the magic.

42 has shown up in multiple other places during the development of this
effort.

At the time we started this effort, we needed all the magic we could
get.
