Netgear WNDR3700 v2
===================

Before purchasing a [wndr3700]({{< relref "wiki/Wndr3700.md" >}}) look on the side of the
outside of the box, which clearly specifies the version number. If there
is no v2, it's a v1. In many cases v1 and v2 routers are mixed up on the
shelf!

You REALLY want the v2. Trust us. It has twice the flash as the v1. The
v1 is NOT supported at this point.

Other Netgear routers you may find...
-------------------------------------

-   WNDR3800 router has twice as much RAM as the WNDR3700v2. The
    WNDR3800 **is** supported with CeroWrt, and is a good choice for
    being future-proof.
-   WNDR3700 v3 router is **not** supported. (The v3 chipset has
    differences that will prevent it from working.)

To determine whether the NetGear [wndr3700]({{< relref "wiki/Wndr3700.md" >}}) gateway you have
purchased is a version 2, look on the bottom of the router. The "v2" is
clearly indicated next to the model number, as shown below.
