Although the CeroWrt site (http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/)
has been quiet, that doesn't mean that we haven't been working.

The CeroWrt-Devel mailing list
(https://lists.bufferbloat.net/listinfo/cerowrt-devel) has been bubbling
with lots of energy all summer and fall, and we're getting close to a
new release that we can recommend to everyone. Here's what's we've been
working on:

-   Significant refinement to the CoDel code, to further knock down
    bufferbloat
-   Update to Linux 3.10 kernel that incorporates much of our earlier
    work on bufferbloat
-   All the good effort from the OpenWrt Barrier Breaker development
    firmware
-   And too many other improvements to mention here

You can check out any number of Bufferbloat videos at
http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/Bloat-videos to learn
more about the problem and our solutions.

If you just want good router firmware, purchase a Netgear WNDR3800 and
burn the [current 3.7.5-2
firmware](http://snapon.lab.bufferbloat.net/~cero2/cerowrt/wndr/3.7.5-2/).
You can also follow our activity on the CeroWrt-devel list to see what's
happening and learn when experimental builds or solid new releases are
available.
