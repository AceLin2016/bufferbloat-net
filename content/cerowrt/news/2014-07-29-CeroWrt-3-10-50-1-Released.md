The CeroWrt 3.10.50-1 build has been released. It has several
improvements, including resyncing with the OpenWrt head, another fix to
wifi that may completely address the problem with bug \#442, a GUI for
the BCP38 rules, and some fixes to the SQM system.

Update - 21Aug2014: This build has proved very stable, and we strongly
recommend that people install it.
