The recent bql-31 build is available for the bold. This build
incorporates work from the Linux 3.3 kernel as well as a number of known
queue disciplines (qdisc) that dramatically relieve bufferbloat. We
believe the DNS/bind and IPv6 code are also working well. The build may
have bugs and may not perform perfectly, but it is certainly better than
the stock firmware or other builds. We'd like to get it in the hands of
people who're willing to report problems (or successes!)

The <link>Wiki</link> page has information about downloading,
installing, and configuring the build.
