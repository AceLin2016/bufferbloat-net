I've been working fixing bufferbloat now for a really long time, and of
late it's been really difficult to keep the lights on and the servers
fed. Last month I'd hit bottom, this month is worse. I put up a
donations page, and got a totally wonderful level of response - enough
to make rent! Then I tripped over an obscure portion of the Amazon EULA,
and ended up refunding everyone's money and cancelling your
subscriptions.

So, I've put up a new subscribe/donations page for the cerowrt portion
of the project, using paypal at:

http://www.teklibre.com/cerowrt/subscribe.html

I won't jimmy wales you'all on further solicitations like this. (I know,
that's what I said last month)

But a little more help in getting over this hump would be very nice to
have.
