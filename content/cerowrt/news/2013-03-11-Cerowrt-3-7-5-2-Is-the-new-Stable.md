What can I say? 3.7.5-2 has been deployed and thoroughly tested at
multiple sites, and under high load, and on places like comcast's cable
network, and it just. keeps. working.

It's time to retire "sugarland" and get into "Modena". Get the [latest
firmware](http://snapon.lab.bufferbloat.net/~cero2/cerowrt/wndr/3.7.5-2/)
or read the [Release
Notes](http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki) for details.

In this release:

Vastly improved ipv6 naming and interopability, 3 new forms of codel and
fq\_codel, much better QoS...

And all the chocolately goodness from OpenWrt Barrier Breaker.

More news to come. Thank you all for your support and donations! We
couldn't have done it without you.
