As noted in the Wiki and Activity pages, there has been a lot of recent
work on CeroWrt. This has led to a usable firmware build that
significantly improves performance with various new AQMs on a home
router.

The bql-40 release incorporates Linux kernel 3.3-rc3, bind 9.9rc2,
defaults to installing the snmpd, fprobe, and avahi packages and has a
somewhat improved AQM. This build is for the bold - use it on your
secondary router. If Linux 3.3 works out we will start a new, more
serious development cycle around it.

Read the <link>BQL\_series\_release\_notes|Release Notes</link> for
details.
