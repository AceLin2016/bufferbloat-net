The "Ocean City" build is as done as it's going to get. It is stable,
but its goals were way too broad to implement in a reasonable time
period. As of mid-December 2011, we have declared victory, and chosen to
focus on the essential experiments to decrease bufferbloat. This puts on
hold all the rc7, rc8, etc. builds previously listed in the Roadmap.
