The newest build of CeroWrt - 3.10.24-8 - is working quite well for us.
There's a [Release
Note](http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/CeroWrt_310_Release_Notes)
page that gives the current status. Note that, although it has been very
stable, this is still an experimental release. It's available at
http://snapon.lab.bufferbloat.net/\~cero2/cerowrt/wndr/3.10.24-8/

The CeroWrt development team has been working to nail down a no-brainer
set of instructions for eliminating bufferbloat - the lag/latency that
kills voice & video chat, gaming, and overall network responsiveness.
The hard part is that optimal configuration of the Smart Queue
Management (SQM) link is difficult - there are tons of options an ISP
can set. Although CeroWrt can adapt to any of them, it's difficult to
find out the exact characteristics of the link you have. Check out the
latest version of our instructions at
