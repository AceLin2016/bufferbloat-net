The code for Cerowrt 3.3 has been frozen now for about a week. There's
some reasons for that, which is why the freeze is "tasty".\
(more news on monday)

Multiple routers have stayed up under various workloads for the week. My
own criterion before I'm happy is two weeks of uptime under heavy
load...

http://huchra.bufferbloat.net/\~cero1/3.3/3.3.3-2/ has proven pretty
stable, but ipv6 was kind of slow.

http://huchra.bufferbloat.net/\~cero1/3.3/dev/3.3.4-3/ is also pretty
stable under all but the highest workloads, and has over double the ipv6
performance as all prior versions. However, we continue to battle with
bug \#379 which is going to take some more (tedious) work to fix.

in the meanwhile I've taken a little time of to work on... well...
you'll find out monday.
