The most recent beta-test CeroWrt (version 3.10.48-2) is working very
well. The incidence of the wifi-related bug \#442 has dropped, and it
otherwise has been stable for almost two weeks. Get it from
http://snapon.lab.bufferbloat.net/\~cero2/cerowrt/wndr/3.10.48-2/

There is a newer version - 3.10.50-1 - that has not been well tested,
but it incorporates another wifi bug-fix. If it checks out, this may be
close to a release candidate.
