Previous Dedications of CeroWrt
===============================

Present release
---------------

The present release of CeroWrt is dedicated to the memory of Dion L.
Johnson III, the "Czar of Free Stuff", who introduced me to the concept
of a "Skunkworks" with
[Skunkware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO_Skunkware) and ended up
helping me get my first job in the Unix industry. The [skunkware
team](ftp://ftp2.sco.com/skunkware/tmp/credits.html) kept the company
relevant, and nobody cared, except for [Ezekiel
Kludge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QECNF-GxbDQ) . I am grateful for
everything Dion taught me, that I've passed down, in building the
bufferbloat effort and the CeroWrt team.

I only wish we had a hot tub still, to hang out in.

CeroWrt 3.7.5 and prior were dedicated to the memories of:
----------------------------------------------------------

[John H Dubois](http://www.spcecdt.com) , who spread email and netnews
through Santa Cruz, Ca, and [The Armory](http://www.armory.com)
geekhouse , spent many lonely years building an entire OS all by
himself, and to his [Liquid nitrogen ice
cream](http://www.armory.com/~spcecdt/cooking/recipes/chocolateIceCream.html)
that he brought to Burning man every year.

[Richard Pitt](http://digital-rag.com) , who helped bring the Internet
to western Canada , wrote the [Digital
Rag](http://digital-rag.com/article.php/Buffer-Bloat-Packet-Lossand) and
put [webcams in eagles
nests](http://www.hancockwildlife.org/article.php/RichardPittFund) .

And:

[Ronald Täht](http://ronsravings.blogspot.com) , who taught me more than
he ever understood.
