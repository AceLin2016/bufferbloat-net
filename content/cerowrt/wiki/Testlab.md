The Bloat-Lab concept
=====================

In our quest for getting duplicatable results, we've created a lab
environment that can be easily replicated, inexpensively.

It consists of 9 routers, doubly connected to the Internet, a x86 based
test and measurement box, a PDU, and a programmable switch.

They can be reconfigured in a variety of configurations.
