Home routers are not getting updated properly: they are a security
nightmare waiting to happen.

We can do better.

While every router should allow the user to do what they want, most
don't ever do security updates, and this is a problem. So the updates
themselves need to be secure, but also automated properly.

The package architecture for openwrt has issues.\
There is no support for checking the dns authentication bit in the core
ipkg system\
(not only that but I have no idea how to do so from normal C, either, as
yet.)

Still it's interesting, needed, useful, and on my very long list.
