{{< issue_description >}}
the iptables version in cerowrt rc5 has multiple problems with inversion
matches. They are fixed as of the last patch series that went by on the
netfilter list.

I do not think the existing iptables upgrade in cerowrt has made it to
openwrt head as yet, and it should be held until these patches stablize.
