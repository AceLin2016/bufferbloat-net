while I have patched xinetd to run with oom=1000, when it forks it
cannot seem to reset the oom value of the forked process back to a sane
value. (I have not folded this patch into the build yet, because of
this)

Secondly, once that actually works, oom-protecting - or not - more stuff
would be desirable.

Dropbear could run out of xinetd for sure... rsync already runs out of
xinetd, netperf does also but some tests fail on the svn version.

Perhaps git-daemon...

Definately some sensors...

It would be great of lighttpd could run out of xinetd - or some web
server - as you only need the web server running rarely... iperf -s
doesn't work out of xinetd either....

nearly every daemon could run out of something like xinetd (I'm not sold
on xinetd, or init, but\
leaving processes around, unmonitored, is a sure recipe for eventual
failure) Monit maybe. systemd and launchd are way too big and
overdesigned for this task.

## History

Off the wall idea: I wonder what size Lennart Poettering's systemd is?
It's like inetd on steroids, and applicable to things other than network
services....

I looked at both systemd and launchd, shuddered, and moved on. I'm not
letting lennart's design philosophy anywhere near an embedded platform.

that said I have half a patch for xinetd to better control the
oom-killer, but for some reason it couldn't set child processes to
anything other than 0 or 1000. I liked very much that it could set
itself to 1000, however, and I thought about putting it in regardless of
the problems.

if anybody wants to play with it, I'll upload it here.

Part 1 of this - getting xinetd to run with the oom killer disabled...
is done.

Part 2 is to get more stuff into inetd.

Actually, the fix I put in place makes the parent process -1000, which
is what we want.

But no matter what I try, it also makes all the child processes -1000.

Ripped patch out of build.

as much as I would like to address this in the 1.0 it needs to be thunk
through carefully and harmonized with stuff run out of init.
