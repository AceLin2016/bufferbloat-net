I had at one point (or so I recall) been able to coax 400+Mbit out of
the router in packet forwarding\
performance. Exactly how I did that, it was back in august, and I was
using higher\
end servers and cards then than I am now.

With bql-34 and my current setup I get only 124Mbit in forwarding
performance between two laptops\
with bql on them. This is with kernel 3.2.5 with bql backported.

It isn't the new qdiscs.

I regressed to rc6 and tried again, only to get 183Mbit that way, using
iperf.\
rc6 was 3.0.4 based.

Admittedly I spend most of my time trying to get good 4 mbit
performance, but I do\
find this puzzling and this strongly indicates a need for a new
oprofile.

I am also crashing the router with heavy wireless traffic.

{{< issue_journal date="2012-02-08T09:01:48" author="Dave Täht" >}}
BQL-36 gets 240Mbit over ipv6 with the default ip6tables rules enabled.\
280 with all the ip6tables rules disabled.

204Mbit with bql set to 9000 and tx 64 and sfqred in place\
234Mbit (no typo!) with tx 2

OK, found it. depth 10, in this case, will cut performance to 170Mbit.

So I think during that testing I'd been fooling with the depth.
