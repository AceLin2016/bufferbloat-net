{{< issue_description >}}
When polipo is configured (/etc/config/polipo) with:

    config 'polipo' 'general'
    ...
        option 'dnsUseGethostbyname' 'false'
        option 'dnsNameServer' '127.0.0.1'

it appears that DNS does not work for polipo. We're using BIND9 running
natively on the devices. However, configured as follows:

    config 'polipo' 'general'
    ...
        option 'dnsUseGethostbyname' 'true'
        option 'dnsNameServer' '127.0.0.1'

DNS does work, however it is slow because this is single-threaded.

We have also tried binding directly to ::1 which appears to have worked
once or twice but not consistently. We have also tried binding to the
interface address which seems to work with
`option 'dnsUseGethostbyname' 'true'`.

## History

I have polipo now using gethostbyname in the rc1 candidate. It would be
good to make this work right in the next release candidate however, and
do some automated testing of both polipo and its caching system, with a
usb stick as well as a usb hard disk.

I switched it back to normal - and on my version of rc4, it worked.

I'm going to write this one off as a problem elsewhere in the system.

Can't duplicate. Reverted back to the old dns method.

I can now consistently get polipo to fail with it's internal resolver.
