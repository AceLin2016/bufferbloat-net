{{< issue_description >}}
From reading other bug reports I see this is in a "Don't do that" status
right now. But this should eventually be fixed

I wanted to disable the open CEROwrt-guest and CEROwrt5-guest interfaces
while leaving the CEROwrt and CEROwrt5 active. However if you disable
the \*-guest interface via the gui then you disable all interfaces for
that radio.

## History

The most straightforward thing to do at present is to put an
unrememberable password on those interfaces and put them in wpa mode.

It really mucks with several levels to delete interfaces, notably with
the firewall rules.

That said, I HAVE in the past been able to remove individual interfaces
without nuking the entire config.

I will verify against the rc6 candidate.

This bug is not for deleting the interfaces. I'm setting the disable
option to 1.

I put delete interfaces into a different bug.

Thank you for clarifying that. I'll take a look in my next smoke test of
rc6

https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/28198 looks good for
https://www.bufferbloat.net/issues/246

will fix in rc7

This will hopefully be fixed in the first rc7 smoketest.

Tried to test with rc7 smoke1 but was unable to because when I go to the
network tab in the web UI it hangs and I eventually have to let the
browser (tried both chrome and firefox) kill the script. I'll retry in
the next smoketest.

@richard: I'll let you know when I have a stable smoketest to test.
rc7-smoketest2 has problems, too, but not the one you've hit.

I'll argue that most of the last several months builds would do the
right thing here.
