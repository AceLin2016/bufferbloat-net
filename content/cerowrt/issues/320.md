Web10g measures all sorts of per-connection tcp statistics that are\
otherwise very hard to get at.

http://www.web10g.org/

I have had this patch in the cerowrt kernel for a while and despite\
fiddling with it, most of what it attempts to measure is thus far not\
useful for bufferbloat, and I can get most of that with a userspace\
tool such as netperf and/or some hooks in the kernel.

Now, maybe it can be made useful, but it tinkles all over the tcp fast\
path, requires maintenance, and I just don't feel like porting it\
forward to 3.1 or 3.2, or waiting for someone else to do so. In\
theory, it looked good. In reality, it's hard to care.

I'm glad I tried it, I'm glad that it's out there and I could try it\
again, but I'd just as soon live without it.

If jacobo has found a use for it, I'm all ears.
