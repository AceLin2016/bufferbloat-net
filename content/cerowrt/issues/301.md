We have SFB; it may be buggy right now.

We hope to see RED light; it's vaporware.

We think we'll need some sort of fair queuing as well as AQM; SFQ looks
good there...

And QFQ looks even better.

And it turned out RED was busted. Folding the patch back into cerowrt
will not be a problem, but as usual with bugs of this kind, I have to
throw out a month's worth of results.

I am building a version of both net-next for x86\_64 and folding in this
patch into cerowrt-rc8

sch\_red: fix red\_change

RED is useful for high throughput routers, I doubt many linux machines\
act as such devices.

I was considering adding Adaptative RED (Sally Floyd, Ramakrishna\
Gummadi, Scott Shender), August 2001

In this version, maxp is dynamic (from 1% to 50%), and user only have
to\
setup min\_th (target average queue size)\
(max\_th and wq (burst in linux RED) are automatically setup)

By the way it seems we have a small bug in red\_change()

if (skb\_queue\_empty(&sch-&gt;q))\
red\_end\_of\_idle\_period(&q-&gt;parms);

First, if queue is empty, we should call\
red\_start\_of\_idle\_period(&q-&gt;parms);

Second, since we dont use anymore sch-&gt;q, but q-&gt;qdisc, the test
is\
meaningless.

Oh well...

\[PATCH\] sch\_red: fix red\_change()

Now RED is classful, we must check q-&gt;qdisc-&gt;q.qlen, and if queue
is empty,\
we start an idle period, not end it.

Also a major problem is that the current linux packet schedulers are
scheduling 'superpackets' - full GSO and TSO offloads - up to 64k-
through the scheduler.

The effect this has on any attempt to classify or schedule packets has
to be seen to be believed.\
A 64\*k\* 'packet', followed by a 64 **byte** packet, is a 1000x1 ratio.
Mere packet oriented schedulers, like PFIFO\_fast, survive this abuse,
but the effect on packets marked background\
or priority, over best effort, is correspondingly, um, 'enhanced'.

Spitting this sort of abuse through a grouping scheduler such as SFB or
SFQ is really bad, as the above effect is magnified. All packet
schedulers that try to do something with bytes rather\
than packets, are similarly problematic.

We never figured out how to handle jumbo frames outside the datacenter
in the first place.

People doing AQM analysis work work MUST turn off TSO and GSO in order
to get a sane result -\
and if you merely turn off TSO, GSO will rise in it's stead on some
devices, and bite you.

(yes, this happened to me)

Even if the device says it's turning TSO off (because it's running at
sub 100Mbit speeds)

(this was on the e1000e driver, at least, while I was manually setting
it below 100Mbit for testing), gso stays on.

The way to turn off both is:

    ethtool -K tso off
    ethtool -K gso off

ethtool: enable GSO and GRO by default

Signed-off-by: Michał Mirosław <mirq-linux@rere.qmqm.pl>\
Signed-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>

If it were up to me, I'd revert half this commit, with a message like:

"Disable GSO by default"

Disable GSO until the effects of unleashing superpackets on the global
internet\
as a whole is better understood by theorists and network designers, and\
the Linux scheduler is revised to handle them properly.
