We haven't tested 6rd for a while, and given Comcast not going forward
with 6rd, aren't in a good place to test it. We never did have a UI for
Comcast's temporary configuration, either. 6to4, on the other hand,
works like a champ on Comcast right now.

If the patches have been lost, please let us know. Even better, help
test 6rd on an ongoing basis.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-09-20T12:58:39" author="Dave Täht" >}}
6RD IS built as part of the sit kernel module, and thus, available by
default.

CONFIG\_IPV6\_SIT=m\
CONFIG\_IPV6\_SIT\_6RD=y

HOWEVER - comcast had required a tiny patch (buried in a gigabyte svn
dump) to do something or other, and also sort of\
had an openwrt script that went with that. So that code's out there.
What's required in places like France,\
remains unknown.

I'll be in a pretty good place to test it in about 24 hours.

Probably you won't need much of anything.

The Comcast mod was a hack so they didn't have to deploy an updated DHCP
server to hand out the addresses. That would have cost them 6 months or
more in starting their 6rd trial. And since that trial is mercifully
over, ditching any dregs of it and having a blog standard 6rd
implementation is the "right thing" to do.

I had hoped to try this directly against freewifi, but they all use
specialized hardware.

So I give up.

I can resolve this issue in france next week. If I remember.
