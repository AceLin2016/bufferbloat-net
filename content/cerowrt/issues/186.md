{{< issue_description >}}
By default, openwrt configures the first radio + ethernet port as a
bridge across the local switch, and wireless. It appears to be picking
up the mac address of the wireless interface when doing so, and works
pretty good, except that thus far I've been unable to coax greater than
60Mbit performance out of it.

It would be useful to be able to NOT configure the ethernet interface as
a bridge, but as a real, separate wired interface for my ongoing
investigation to QoS and multicast issues, in particular.

Attempting to do so, results in the following - even after disabling the
wireless interfaces entirely.

root@aitne:\~\# ifconfig eth0\
eth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr C4:3D:C7:B0:AE:36\
inet addr:192.168.130.1 Bcast:192.168.130.255 Mask:255.255.255.0\
inet6 addr: fe80::c63d:c7ff:feb0:ae36/64 Scope:Link\
UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1\
RX packets:1219 errors:0 dropped:1218 overruns:0 frame:0\

collisions:0 txqueuelen:16\
RX bytes:130214 (127.1 KiB) TX bytes:338924 (330.9 KiB)\
Interrupt:4

100% drops.

Even though, the other ethernet interface is fine

eth1 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr C4:3D:C7:B0:AE:37\
inet addr:192.168.115.171 Bcast:192.168.115.255 Mask:255.255.255.0\

RX bytes:669121 (653.4 KiB) TX bytes:312308 (304.9 KiB)\
Interrupt:5

openwrt bleeding edge, r26878

There are no revealing errors in the log, this is all that is said about
eth0 and eth1.

root@aitne:\~\# dmesg | grep eth0\
eth0: Atheros AG71xx at 0xb9000000, irq 4\

eth0: link up (1000Mbps/Full duplex)\

config switch\
option name rtl8366s\
option reset 1\
option enable\_vlan 1\
\# Blinkrate: 0=43ms; 1=84ms; 2=120ms; 3=170ms; 4=340ms; 5=670ms\
option blinkrate 2

config switch\_vlan\
option device rtl8366s\
option vlan 1\
option ports "0 1 2 3 5t"

I'm about to turn off vlan and see what happens.

Turned off the vlan on the switch, I see packets YES! Bwhahahahaa

the wireless interfaces insist on coming up on the same mac as eth0

perhaps there is a mac wired into the ethernet interface that is not
being seen?

The only cure for this, assuming there is no mac addr assigned, is to
either\
invent one, or buy a OUI.

I REALLY want to route, not bridge.

I am frustrated enough by bridging to want to go pure routing. I can
easily, with various forms of traffic on the switch, totally saturate
the wireless bridge. Regrettably there is no extra mac on the wndrs.

Buying a full set of 'bufferbloat' mac ids will cost 1750.00 dollars.

This is a possible fix for the duplicate MAC address issue, the same
trick is already applied to the Routerstation boards.

Oh, thank you. I did NOT see this fix when it went by.

automagic mac generation fix appears to work well. Would suggest pushing
into openwrt head, if you haven't already.

Well, I'll carry this patch forward if I have to.
