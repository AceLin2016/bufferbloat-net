Right now, entering, for example, upstream name servers into the Luci
page for configuration doesn't work. This gets people both in corporate
environments (since the local name servers may show domains not publicly
available), and for configuring things\
like Comcast's nice DNSSEC capable name servers.

So we need to get bind properly integrated into the UI.

As far as exactly what to do for this particular problem, this captures
a quick conversation:

      chroot/etc/bind/conf/forwarders.conf
     uncomment named.conf's forwarders line
     walla
     edit /etc/bind/conf/forwarders.conf
     to point at those
     have a script rewrite them if needed
     ok; seems like a plan.
