{{< issue_description >}}
Running "uci changes" from the command line results in errors in the
default config.

The problems are in /etc/config/babeld and /etc/config/debloat. The
first file has a missing ' mark on line 16 (option 'carrier\_sense '1')
-- missing ' after sense. The second has 'option' in quotes, which seems
to fail to parse.
