with 6 interfaces, and a dns server, and access to the router controlled
by iptables and xinetd, it's hard to renumber interfaces to have a
different subnet allocation - and ipv6 is also problematic.

I have a simple script that does 95% of the work that could be improved
to also be accessible via luci "renumber/rename home network" - which
would eliminate the tedium.

Is this script in the build? Is it documented? For people to put a
router into service for real, they had better not have to renumber their
networks; it's easier to fix a single router.

I just renumbered with the sed scripts in the wiki to 192.168.1.x,
hoping I'd win. I lost.

I note that <link>Default network numbering</link> says that

    1-30: secured area for other machines
    33-65: secured area for wired

Here's the thing: I did an informal poll of my Bell Labs co-workers I'm
about to inflict CeroWrt on. About half of them have static, existing
numbering plans.

In my personal case, my static addresses are all in the 1-30 range; I
suspect that's going to be common (or hope so, anyway).

So I suspect the two areas should be swapped to reduce the amount of
renumbering required.

{{< issue_journal date="2011-09-21T16:24:11" author="Dave Täht" >}}
Exactly. I basically reserved the bottomost range for static ips. The
other ranges are all dynamic (well, the firstmost\
address in each range is excluded from dhcp's dynamic lease assignment)

that said, this can be improved.

{{< issue_journal date="2011-09-21T16:26:36" author="Dave Täht" >}}
So, here's an option:

we change to 172.30.42.1 as the base address of the router.

We use a /26 in this case, to give us 1-62 as valid ips.

We reserve 34-62 as dynamically addressed space.

This DOES mess up the dmz idea - where my 'plan' such as it was was to
have the dmz on a different vlan.

Well, right now, I can't access 192.168.1.13 (or similar addresses). I
doubt I'll be the last.\
My colleagues seem to all be using 192.168.1 addresses as their plan.

A DMZ VLAN would be nice someday; but the interesting question also
being begged is how do we deal with a VLAN for an IPsec tunnel... DMZ's,
however, in the IPv4 world are hard for most to come by, given IPv4
address shortage.

For now, I suspect KISS is in order.

That's more or less my fault in the current design as I had several
requests for\
vlan support early on. And, I suspect, we'll hav emore.

In your case.

change /etc/config/network to use a 255.255.255.192 netmask instead of
224\
for the se00 device, change it to 192.168.1.1, and tell\
/etc/config/dhcp to start\
at 34 for that interface

as I described later in the bug

I'm going to bed

To clarify that slightly, what you did wrong (I think) - was put a new
/27 up\
in the 0-31 address space, with no router IP address for it. Due to it
being a\
/27 it can't see any means of getting anywhere, so it goes boom.

to kind of keep the dmz idea alive, we COULD just do an alias for\
se00:0 of 192.168.1.1\
but that leads to all sorts of hassle on the same physical wire.

Ah, well, it can move to the end of the address space. Trust me, there\
are many vlan freaks out there.

All I did was run the sed scripts from the wiki.

but then you had a .13 fixed ip address.

there is no address range for .13 that has a router ip on it.
