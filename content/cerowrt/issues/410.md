Hi,\
is there any chance to get support for massively popular and cheap
tp-link devices based on ar71xx ?\
TP-Link wr703 \[1\]\
TP-Link wr741nd \[2\]\
TP-Link wr1043nd \[3\]

just to name a few

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2012-09-27T14:52:45" author="Dave Täht" >}}
The first device I looked at only had 4MB of flash. Cerowrt requires at
least 12.

Overall our strategy is to create new stuff, push it into the mainline
kernel or package, and push up into openwrt.\
from there it flows down into other devices, inside of their own limits.

While there might be specific hardware that needs debloating (such as
adding BQL to an ethernet driver) in different hardware than we
currently use - we have no resources at present to do that work, nor do
we have resources to build or QA it, nor even purchase the hardware.

If a router maker or chipset vendor were to sign up and pay for a
debloating exercise then things would be different.\
(I'd prefer that they'd merely do the work themselves)

Sure, I'd love it to be able to extend our efforts to other commonly
available hardware like the raspberry pi, dreamplug, but budget is
non-existent. About the only thing I plan to do is add a kvm version.

Lastly:

Almost everything "good" and "stable" in present day cerowrt is now in
openwrt, and it is easy to layer the chief changes to openwrt on top of
openwrt for a specific OS (notably the debloat package in the
ceropackages repo, also some kernel patches in the cerowrt-3.3 repo). So
go ahead and build for your platform and let us know the results.

Has anybody managed to reimplement Cerowrt on regular OpenWrt ?\
Is there anything special kernel patch or some package that Cerowrt has
that is missing in OpenWrt?
