When fiddling around in the UI, I have had up to 6 different named
processes running. I don't know how or why... In general, this happens
mostly when futzing with interfaces a lot. A very lot.

hmm. This is bad. xinetd is only supposed to be able to spawn 1. Period.

Something else may be firing up named.

A coworker who you loaned a 3700 to also experienced this. We spotted
two running on his box while debugging my insane DHCP issues.

I also notice something is checking the local time using ntpdc, which
fails as ntpd isn't running it seems, but something similar. Is it
possible this script is restarting named?

the xinetd.d/named file needed a instances = 1 line to enforce the
window where named hadn't fully started yet.

Or so I hope. Fixed in rc6, will test further then. in the meantime, you
can add instances = 1 to your /etc/xined.d/named file and see if the
problem recurs. thx for spotting this!

I have not seen multiple nameds ever runnig with the rc6-smoketest.
Please reopen bug if it recurs.

I managed to have 6 named processes running today in testing, even with
xinetd instances=1. Not good. Box ran out of ram and stopped taking
connections.

The right answer is to fix ntp for dnssec, period, and move that version
of ntp into the ceropackages github repo.

Which requires braincells I do not have at present. I haven't even got
so far as to make it work on x86. when I poked into the guts of ntp it
was not obvious - or possible - to separate out ntp -g processig from
normal processing, easily.

Why not fix NTP to start with?

ntpd does not actually start running, and the bind 9 monitoring script\
to enable dnssec seems to be using ntpdc to poll.

I think there is another ntp process that uses port 123, and killing\
that off allows ntpd to start.

yes, ntpdate getting spawned somehow is part of the problem. I am
ripping that out entirely.

I should have fixed ntp in the first place, but this bug was long before
I had a deep understanding of the right calls to make, and even then,
I'd rather someone with a deep understanding of ntp and dnssec to tackle
that, rather than me... if it was easy, I'd have done it....

This is fixed in rc6, or so I think. luci was firing up ntpdate,
blocking ntp and ntpc entirely.

that said, I have no idea how named could get fired up multiple times
from xinetd.

I have not seen this bug in ages. Please test with the current build
(3.3.2-8 or later) and let me know.
