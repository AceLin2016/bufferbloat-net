{{< issue_description >}}
When 6to4 is used on Cerowrt 3.3.8-14 and prior, the default route for
ipv6 is not propagated via quagga-babeld.

root@gw:/etc/quagga\# ip -6 route | grep default\
default via ::192.88.99.1 dev 6to4-ge01 metric 1024

The 2002::/16 route is propagated to all clients. Note that it ends up
in the kernel table.

root@gw:/etc/quagga\# ip -6 route | grep 6to4\
2002::/16 dev 6to4-ge01 proto kernel metric 256

If I manually on the client add the default route via

ip -6 route add default via fe80::204e:7fff:fe4a:9627 dev gw11

Things work.

So my guess is that the default route in the 6to4 netifd script needs to
also be inserted into the kernel table in order to be passed to clients
via quagga.

I have denis's patch as well installed for RT\_PROT messages, but that
doesn't appear to affect this behavior.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2012-08-10T20:32:54" author="Dave Täht" >}}
I am dealing with three additional different bugs here.

0\) quagga is not pushing the 6to4 default route out to other babel
nodes.

1\) On the local interface,\
the following syntax only adds one 2002:: based addresses to the listed\
interfaces. (se00)

config interface 'ge01'\
option proto '6to4'\
option adv\_subnet '1'\
option wan\_device 'ge00'\
option metric '1'\
option ttl '64'\
list adv\_interface 'gw00'\
list adv\_interface 'gw10'\
list adv\_interface 'se00'\
list adv\_interface 'sw00'\
list adv\_interface 'sw10'

Interestingly, although luci will write this syntax, when it re-reads it
only finds the first (gw00) interface. (see pic)

(it will also read the old syntax and convert to this)

I have been refreshing luci a lot, but somehow perhaps I'm out of sync?
(no,\
my last commit was 6c6af10f0859cbe5d61f5d2d60dfc9ea5215285e

And regardless only the third (se00) of these interfaces gain a 2002
address.

2\) This generates a radvd file for the one interface that works as
below.\
Perhaps I need to put in a default route statement explicitly?

interface se00\
{\
AdvLinkMTU 1480;\
AdvDefaultPreference medium;\
IgnoreIfMissing on;\
AdvSendAdvert on;\
AdvOtherConfigFlag on;\
AdvSourceLLAddress on;

prefix 2002:328a:a616:1::1/64\
{\
AdvOnLink on;\
AdvAutonomous on;\
AdvRouterAddr off;\
};

RDNSS fe80::204e:7fff:fe4a:9623\
{\
};

DNSSL home.lan\
{\
};\
};

The one client connected that way (haven't verified it's functionality)\
isn't getting out.

3\) when netifd runs it deletes up the addresses gained via ahcp, wiping
out the mesh.

config interface 'gw01'\
option proto 'ahcp'

config interface 'gw11'\
option proto 'ahcp'

Both I and jow changed netifd to insert user routes as static (which is
arguably more correct, anyway)

But although I changed quagga to distribute static as well, it still
doesn't pick up the 6to4-ge01 default route for ipv6. I tried adding the
device to the quagga "network" stanza, to no luck... It is not shown as
an export from vtysh, either.

0.0.0.0/0 metric 0 (exported)\
50.138.160.0/21 metric 0 (exported)\
192.168.1.0/27 metric 0 (exported)\
192.168.1.64/27 metric 0 (exported)\
192.168.1.96/27 metric 0 (exported)\
192.168.1.128/27 metric 0 (exported)\
192.168.1.160/27 metric 0 (exported)\
192.168.1.224/32 metric 0 (exported)\
::50.138.166.22/128 metric 0 (exported)\
2002::/16 metric 0 (exported)\
2002:328a:a616:bab5::1/128 metric 0 (exported)

Perhaps I can statically add it to the zebra config?

moving on to the other issues...

the 6to4 portion of the netifd scripts does not do address assignment.
I'm not sure if it should, actually, when controlled by the adv\_subnet
variable. Perhaps a new variable, "assign\_subnet" would be more
appropro, or rs solicitations enabled in this case to automagically get
a slaac address...

(btw, I like the scripts they are very clean and easy to read)

and have no idea how to tell it to ignore interfaces run with ahcp.

I was successfully able to propagate a default ipv6 route for 6to4 via
adding\
a stanza in zebra.conf

interface 6to4-ge01\
ipv6 route ::/0 2002:c058:6301::

I'm not certain I wanted to do it that way (certainly I don't want to
announce routes via that interface)

Jow fixed portions of this bug (1 and 2)

In packages:

proto/6x4: cast 6to4 adv\_interface to string when saving to uci, fixes
6in4.

Jow moved netifd to install userspace routes as static

\[package\] netifd: bump to git head, userspace routes are installed
with RTPR\_STATIC

This did not actually fix quagga. I put in a workaround in \#note-3 -
but I'm not happy with having to embed the\
anycast route there, even if it is pretty generic...

This leaves netifd mucking with ahcpd managed interfaces when it
shouldn't be as the last big remaining issue here.

Thx jow for leaping on this.

Could you post the output of "show ipv6 route" vtysh command with and
without the workaround?

Actually, no, the correct line would be:

set\_6to4\_radvd\_prefix "\$sid" "\$adv\_interface" \\\
"\$wancfg" "\$(printf "%s:%x::/64"\
\$prefix6 \$adv\_subnet) \\\
"\$adv\_valid\_lifetime" "\$adv\_preferred\_lifetime"

arguably "subnet6" is misnamed.

There is another bug in this script in correctly adding multiple\
interfaces. It succeeds on the first, but not the rest, and thus far I\
can't figure out why.

There is another bug in that arguably the interface itself should have\
a prefix lifetime (monitored somehow) and mtu set and I'd argue for\
marking it secondary in the hope that someday real ipv6 addresses\
would become common.

And last bug, in that with the latest quagga OR dnsmasq, radvd is not\
needed, except for detecting and generating the 6to4 prefix.

Setting the radvd adv subnet with leading zeros is deliberate and not a
bug.\
Thats a special feature of radvd, it will populate the leading zeros
with the prefix of the Base6to4 interface specified in the same prefix
section. See the radvd man page for details on this.

I have no idea what's going to happen vs a vs dnsmasq vs quagga vs the
new relay6d stuff.

I'm just happy radvd is going to go away. soon.
