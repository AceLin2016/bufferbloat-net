{{< issue_description >}}
With the addition of some dhcpv6 client to our overflowing request
bucket, we are faced with yet another need to somehow\
propagate ipv6 prefixes and related information across the rest of the
stack.

dibbler is being built now, which features PD. isc-dhcp has been built
for a long time, but the PD version (if available)\
would probably require the currently too-HUGE-tu-use isc-dhcp code, and
multiple daemons. I have hope that moving PD support into\
AHCP would be easy, but that's only hope at this point - and

Great. Once we have PD - what do we do with it? We have to get names
into DNS with nsupdate, and push PD stuff into radvd,\
ahcp, babeld, and THEN onto all the interfaces sanely...

and then... if we have additional routers --- get ADDITIONAL PD working
inside the network. Sanely. Securely. Etc.

Building dibbler is only the first step.

(just when we had 6to4 working great)

getting a grip on the work involved in doing PD right **can** be done
during rc7 but I had no time budgeted for this.
