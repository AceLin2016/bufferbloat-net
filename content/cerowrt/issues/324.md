In my quest for lower latency throughout the system, I increased the
clock interrupt from 100 to 256, enabled low latency desktop, and wanted
to see what bugs I would flush out by doing so.

This is one... I had put down working on the switch last year, in march,
after beating the buffering problem on it, or so I thought. I never got
around to seeing if the the wfq algorithm on it could be made to work -
the early data sheets had glowingly cool stuff on them, the later ones
deleted that info, so it seems likely that much of the QoS system
on-chip actually doesn't work. That said, finding ways to expose more of
the switch's functionality higher up on the stack would be good.

Now, previously, I'd tried for a clock interrupt of 1000, and exposed at
least two other bugs elsewhere, this one is new...

normal

Just to add to this in my own building of openwrt trying to use
combinations of config\_hz 1000, forced preemption, and voluntary
preemption:

1\. Using forced (desktop) preemption causes the above bug. Even if you
use a slower clock interval. Interestingly, even though this appears:
"BUG: scheduling while atomic: swconfig/1340/0x00000002", after a minute
or so, the ethernet chips start functioning fine (perhaps with a release
and renew on the connected clients). The wireless doesn't appear to be
affected.

2\. Using config\_hz 1000 with server or voluntary preemption, a similar
issue occurs were the ethernet switch seems to fail, but I see no
immediate error logs in the kernel message. Wireless again appears to be
ok.

3\. I can build a successful firmware using voluntary preemption and
config\_hz 250. The router seems stable using voluntary preemption.
Perhaps using a custom HZ value (like 500) could be a workaround.

Have you noticed any positive effects from your configuration?

In my case I was hoping for mildly better behavior from QFQ, which I
seem to be getting.

I'm not much of a kernel hacker, but I think I was able to override the
kernel tick timer by editing:

build\_dir/toolchain-mips\_r2\_gcc-4.5-linaro\_uClibc-0.9.32/linux/arch/arm/include/asm/param.h

But I may be wrong since I think that gets overwritten from source when
building the kernel? I also tried to set config\_hz\_500=y and
config\_hz=500 in the relevant config files, but I'm not sure if they
are sticking. Any help would be appreciated on how to actually change
the default.

Anyways, enabling kernel timing stats debugging and installing powertop,
I see there are about 400 "wakeups-from-idle per second" when doing
minor browsing. Ath9k uses about 170 in idle. So I'd argue that we need
just around 500Hz just to maintain responsiveness at least on the
software side. I'm guessing that the interrupts can go much higher than
the defined 500Hz though when required, because it shoots up to
2000-3000 (eth0) when doing a simple Samba transfer.

I'm not sure how the interrupts are related to the HZ or context
switching though. It's probably complicated.

One effect is that Samba transferring a bulk file from the local PC to
the attached HDD much faster now, about 16MB/s vs. 12MB/s for the
default HZ value. Idle times according to vmstat are also more accurate.

I'm actually just using openwrt trunk, not cerowrt. Is the cerowrt
toolchain available for me to build? Then I can test QFQ.

How it affects latency? I'm not sure. Using the default QoS scripts with
appropriate limits (txqueuelen, buffers, ECN, timestamps), a Netalyzer
test looks the same. But then I'm not using your improved QoS scripts.

Let me know how I can help.
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-12-19T23:15:32" author="Dave Täht" >}}
the cerowrt toolchain is presently a small mass of patches flying in
loose formation, and just barely buildable by me at the moment. I'll get
it independently buildable again.

I'm engaged in pushing up the good stuff into openwrt as fast as I can,
so others can fiddle with the good stuff (like QFQ) there. I probably
won't be done doing that until after Christmas.
(needed-for-me-to-cleanup-and-submit patches are the latest iproute2,
and QFQ added to the kernel scheduler packages)

Your results with samba are pretty interesting. My assumption is that
the samba daemon is waking up more often than it would otherwise....

Is this samba 3.0 or 3.6? I just pushed samba 3.6.1 into the
ceropackages repo (which is largely buildable from normal openwrt, all
you have to do is add it to your feeds.conf, and select the package in
it)

I'm curious as to what these are for you and your situation. It's looks
like you are using an arm platform?

"default QoS scripts with appropriate limits (txqueuelen, buffers, ECN,
timestamps"

I note that almost universally I'm getting better shaping results from
very small tx rings - 4 in cerowrt's case. I also set the openrd (an arm
platform) as low as they would go - 20 - and would like to go lower in
that case.

Actually, the test with samba was the older Samba 3.0 release. I just
rebuilt the openwrt trunk with 3.6, and now I'm getting 13MB/s vs 16MB/s
with a large file transfer to an attached usb HDD. One thing I've
noticed is that Samba 3.6 takes significantly more memory to run. The
slow down may be due to RAM and cache swapping. I also have a swap file
enabled for this reason (it's easy to run out of RAM).

Overall I'd take my limited benchmark with a big grain of salt. It would
seem it's limited by the CPU and the scheduler giving the smbd process
enough time (also giving the USB interface enough time). I also tried
setting the TCP TOS for samba to TCP\_CORK since I was doing mainly bulk
transfers.

As for my QoS settings; with my slow connection (6000Kbps/1000Kbps),
using a txqueuelen of 2 rarely drops packets. I have only a handful of
dropped packets over the course of a week. On my Windows 7 clients, the
ethernet driver also allows me to set TX and RX buffers to 2. This is
pretty good, because I have some other clients that only allow 128 or
256 minimums.

ECN and timestamps are enabled. I don't see why they aren't enabled by
default in openwrt trunk. I also enabled them on my Windows 7 clients.

I tried applying ethtool -G eth0 rx 16 tx 16, and various other values,
on my WNDR3700v2, but it crashes the router immediately. I can set a
higher value, rx 64 tx 64, and it doesn't crash immediately, but
eventually (over the course of a few hours).

I seen your ticket about applying ethtool very early in the boot
process, so I will try that next. Can you link to the boot file I can
edit to apply that?
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-12-27T13:10:22" author="Dave Täht" >}}
You are experiencing packet drops (everyone does) but they are just
hidden somewhere in the system.

Anyway, to reduce latency on the driver side:

See the two ethtool lines in:

https://github.com/dtaht/cerofiles/blob/master/files/etc/init.d/boot

This was the only way I was able to reduce the tx ring to sanity was
here, before it booted fully.

I've gone as low as 2, actually, but that did cut bandwidth (helped on
latency, though), and I do hope that BQL will run at 16 to 64 as well or
better as things run now at tx 4.

I have been running of late with qfq or sfq, and a longer txqueuelen
(150 or so). SFQ and QFQ help a lot on wireless, not so much at gigE
speeds, but help a lot at 100Mbit or less (with an uplink)

I have some scripts I'm working on in the deBloat repo that almost work
on openwrt as I write.

I tried setting ethtool -G eth0 rx 16 tx 16 in my boot config, but the
router refuses to boot. It just hangs during the init process.

The lowest I can successfully boot is tx 64 rx 64 for eth0 and eth1. I'm
using the latest openwrt trunk. I also tried 32, 8, 2. The defaults are
tx 64 rx 128.

Are you only changing the tx value? Perhaps that's the difference.

Just an update on Samba. Turns out that the samba socket options have a
big effect on bulk transfer performance.

TCP\_CORK alone has worse performance for bulk transfers than just
TCP\_NODELAY.

The best combination I found was:

socket options = TCP\_NODELAY IPTOS\_LOWDELAY TCP\_CORK SO\_SNDBUF=65536
SO\_RCVBUF=65536.

Those options held network utilization at 15.5% on a 1Gbit connection.

Increasing the buffer size allowed me to obtain 18MB/s transfer rates to
the attached USB HDD. 32768 sized buffers also worked almost as well.

I'm using the latest openwrt &gt;trunk. I also tried 32, 8, 2. The
defaults are tx 64 rx 128.

TX rings and RX rings are very different. I usually set TX to 2 or 4 in
the early stage boot process (in the /etc/init.d/boot script), and don't
touch the rx ring - which should be about 128...

My latest efforts use bql, which eliminates (theoretically) the need to
fiddle with tx rings at all.

I do plan to revisit the clock issue at some point tho.
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2012-04-20T00:14:15" author="Dave Täht" >}}
No need to fiddle with tx anymore whatsoever, with bql.

However, on routers with tso/gso/ufo support, and possibly lro/gro, it
helps to turn those OFF. The wndr has none of those features, x86s do.

I am running successfully with a 256 clock now.
