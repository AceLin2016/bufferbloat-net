{{< issue_description >}}
I have tried to convince polipo to work. It has worked only sporadically
for\
months now, To try and nail the issue, I configured it to try to talk
to\
127.0.0.1, ::1, and an external dns resolver to equal ill effect.

All dns lookups fail when dnsgethostbyname = false.

\#\#\# SECTION daemon\
pidFile = "/var/run/polipo.pid"\
daemonise = true

\#\#\# SECTION general\
dnsNameServer = "192.168.1.1"\
proxyAddress = "::"\
chunkHighMark = 10485760\
dnsUseGethostbyname = false\
logSyslog = true\
allowedClients = "127.0.0.1", "172.16.0.0/12"

\#\#\# SECTION cache\
cacheIsShared = true

\#\#\# SECTION pmm

\#\#\# VALUES THAT ARE DISABLED WHEN EMPTY\
diskCacheRoot = ""\
logFile = ""\
Host gw.home.lan lookup failed: Timeout (131072).

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-09-15T22:07:54" author="Dave T채ht" >}}
configuring it to use usegethostbyname=true works consistently with
local, remote, and ipv6 resolvers.

I have debated about updating polipo as the current version is quite
ancient.

That said, after doing so, would require a round of testing, against
ipv6, ivp4, the two different resovlvers, and I wouldn't mind if we
threw in some dscp prioritization in there as well.
