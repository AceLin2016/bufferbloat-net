{{< issue_description >}}
In testing with a real cablemodem, with a /60 provisioned, only the
first was picked up in cerowrt's default configuration.

Furthermore, the wide-dhcp script would assign all the interfaces the
same /64 network (modified by the eui-64)

The attached dhcpv6 capture file shows a trace of the attempted
transaction.

The traces indicate that the ADVERTISE offers a /64 IAPD. I suggest
updating the SOLICIT to include "::/60" for the IAPD per RFC3633 to hint
that a shorter prefix is desired.

there is a new tiny dhcp6-pd daemon under development that I will try
next. continuing with the dead wide, and the huge dibbler and isc-dhcp
is not worth it.

The new dhcp-pd daemon in cerowrt 3.7.5 and later works correctly in
nearly all cases
