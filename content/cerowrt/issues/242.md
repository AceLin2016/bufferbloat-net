{{< issue_description >}}
When ssh'ing into a remote host through a cerowrt router, idle ssh
connections seem to stop working. This happens when the connection is
idle for what seems like a rather short time.

I added this to /etc/rc.local, and the problem went away:

sysctl -w net.netfilter.nf\_conntrack\_tcp\_timeout\_established=432000

This sets a 5 day close time. This is probably insane, but works well
for me so far. Of course, I've only had the box in play for 1.5 days...

You are doing great stuff.

I use ipv6 mostly, which never times out. I will add that to the default
sysctl.conf in the rc6 build

I don't have a problem with 4 days. That gets you through a weekend.

In rc6
