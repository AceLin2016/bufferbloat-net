Subject: \[RFC\] ipv6 over wireless classification issue?\
Date: Sun, 23 Oct 2011 12:23:25 +0200\

After slowly working my way down from verifying the apps to ECN
handling\
and up from the drivers... I've been (also) slowly working on getting\
wireless qos/aqms to work better, on ipv6. (I need to get to having a\
spectrum analyzer or better instrumentation...) I was puzzled about
dscp\
marked ipv6 packets responding differently.

Perhaps this is it. I'm not making this a commit yet (untested code!)

case htons(ETH\_P\_IP):\
dscp = ip\_hdr(skb)-&gt;tos& 0xfc;\
break;\
+ case htons(ETH\_P\_IPV6):\

return 0;\
}

A\) Elsewhere in the stack ipv4\_get\_dsfield is the equivalent of the\
ip\_hdr(skb)-&gt;tos& 0xfc line\
B) It appears ipv6\_get\_dsfield is safe to call from non-ipv6 enabled\
systems

So my thought would be to also harmonize this with ipv4\_get\_dsfield...

C\) And I doubt that slamming arp packets into the VI queue would be\
acceptable yet (as per the ANTs discussion of a few months back, ARP,\
ND, RA, RS, DHCP, and possibly DNS, ssh (marked interactive), etc might\
do better in the VI queue)\
(however this part of the patch is not relevant to the IPv6 issue, it's\
just the patch I wanted to try)

D\) Lastly, Later on in this function only dscp's first 3 bits (CS0 -\
CS7) are used to classify packets into the queues, where a mildly saner\
version would use a lookup table to also do sane things with the\
'immediate' bit, perhaps settable via userspace from via sysfs, sysctl,\
or proc.

Currently fixed in both taht-tnq and cerowrt rc7. Better patches on the
way.
