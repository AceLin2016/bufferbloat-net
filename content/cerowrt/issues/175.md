I hope to get around to signing bufferbloat.net shortly. That gets me to
being able to use it from an update system that uses wget by default.

Just because the domain name to IP address mapping is secure, that does
not mean the TCP connection will not be trapped by some transparent
proxy sitting in an ISP or that your data was received unmodified...

Might be better to create a certificate authority, and install it in the
router itself, so you can make truly secure TLS connections.

A problem is every CA seemingly has to be slightly different to handle a
vpn, a web site, etc. but I'd dearly like to do this.
