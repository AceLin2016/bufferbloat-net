{{< issue_description >}}
with a DNSSec enabled and split dns enabled default setup that "just
worked" out of the box, bind could be an adaquate substitute and
superset for dnsmasq in the name services case.

That said dnsmasq has a much tighter integration with dhcp than we do at
present.

On the gripping hand, it would be a great proof of concept
