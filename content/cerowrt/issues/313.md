{{< issue_description >}}
Many simulations that I've read tend to use a per packet, rather than
per byte, form of RED.

This makes enormous sense in that a version of RED that does it only on
bytes barely budges when faced with pure ack packets rather than mixed
workloads. And certainly doesn't account very well for asymmetric\
bandwidths.

regrettably, RED in linux is bytes, with an average packet size
parameter. Twiddle that number as I may and I don't get particularly
good results. So writing/finding a version of red that comes closer to
the ns2 model may help.
