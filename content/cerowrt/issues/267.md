The report:

This is on an 802.11g (sw00) channel, since there seems to be an issue
with DNS on the .11a (sw10) channel. Interestingly enough, when I
associate with the .11a guest (sw11) channel, the DNS works. (Go figure;
would you like me to file a bug report on that?)

I've seen this too. bind9 is supposed to scan the available interfaces
every two minutes, and it seems possible to trigger a new scan when a
new interface comes up OR have some linux specific monitoring thing
(inotify, kernel event?)

Certainly all the wireless interfaces are not active when named
starts...

I also note that this report is AFTER we upgraded to bind 9.8.1....

OK, A closer look reveals that the interface sw10 does not have an IP
address, even though gw10 (and all the others) do.

Possibly related are the following "bad number" error messages from
logread:

Found it. The config stanza for sw10 in /etc/config/network had some
funky bridging and ifname lines. Commenting them out brings back the IP
number assignment, (and presumably DNS et al.)...

thx! I'll fix this in rc6-smoketest8

{{< issue_journal date="2011-09-15T13:02:16" author="Dave Täht" >}}
or rather, I would, if that was a file showing problems in it. But it
doesn't. So maybe something about the autogeneration of wifi interfaces
messes with this. I will test before releasing smoketest8....

the syntax of the /etc/config/network file had grown much pickier about
quoting than previous. The quotes are now liberally throughout and
appear to work. Smoketest9 will contain the fixes.

Thank you for the spot! as this disabled dhcp entirely on the main
wireless interfaces it was very bad...

No worries! "All bugs are shallow, etc. etc. etc." ;-)

Just confirming that rc6 has fixed the issue for me.

so I (or you) can close this bug?
