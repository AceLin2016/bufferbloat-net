Dave said "Explicitly identifing a wndr3800 as a wndr3800 will need a
/etc/defconfig/ set of files created."

We'll figure out what needs to be done.

I think that these files come from **cerofiles** repository in folder
**files/etc/defconfig/**

There might be other configurations also like Dave suggest

While it runs today, when it appears upstream in OpenWRT it will break
us, so we can't close this yet.

I believe this to be basically fixed. I wouldn't mind if I could change
a few\
fixed parameters to be larger values based on the extra ram (bind for
one), but\
it's good enough....
