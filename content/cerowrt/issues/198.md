The firewall rules I did can be simplified when using the luci
interface.

## History

While I was delighted to see multiple ports being expressible (via
spaces) in the firewall rules, they still generate one rule per port, by
default, and qos, uses commas and : to represent ranges.

I'm going to close this one and create a new one for optimizing the
firewall rules more.

That said, the firewall rules as they exist now need to be thoroughly
tested.
