&gt; Fix a code path in tcp\_rcv\_rtt\_update() that was comparing
scaled and\
&gt; unscaled RTT samples.\
&gt;\
&gt; The intent in the code was to only use the 'm' measurement if it
was a\
&gt; new minimum.  However, since 'm' had not yet been shifted left 3
bits\
&gt; but 'new\_sample' had, this comparison would nearly always
succeed,\
&gt; leading us to erroneously set our receive-side RTT estimate to the
'm'\
&gt; sample when that sample could be nearly 8x too high to use.\
&gt;\
&gt; The overall effect is to often cause the receive-side RTT estimate
to\
&gt; be significantly too large (up to 40% too large for brief periods
in\
&gt; my tests).\
