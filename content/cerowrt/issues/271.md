I'm told that network devices are no longer trusted sources of entropy
for random number generation,\
yet in a router device, there isn't a lot of entropy to be had from
elsewhere.

I had hoped that hardware makers would add rngs to their chipsets long
ago, they have plenty of sources onchip to tap for essential randomness.
But nooo...

lacking essential randomness things like ssh keys, ssl, and wpa wireless
encryption become VERY predictable.

What other entropy sources can be used?

The right answer is to inject more entropy from the wireless signal
strength, interrupts, packet sizes internally, ethernet arrival time,
etc, in addition to using a userspace daemon.

It would be nice to have entropy for routers that don't have hardware
rng. Right now there is nearly none in the ar71xx\
chipset...

without entropy crypto is not crypto...

What is a culturally acceptible form of re-introducing entropy to Linux?

The rngd daemon can introduce entropy:\

And here is a hack for using wireless data to do so:\

Otherwise, ask nicely on the linux-network mailing list, or the
linux-wireless mailing list\
