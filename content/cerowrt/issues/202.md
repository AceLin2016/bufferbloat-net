The description is pretty vague.

Thanks for checking it out luis!

I tried to get STA mode to work from the gui, and it failed to connect
to anything or get a dhcp address. I have not had time to look at it
further, if you or someone else can, I'd appreciate it.

Mostly pilot error - I'd not managed to get nat working, and the DHCP
assigned address wouldn't let any packets through, thus making named not
work at all AND regect what it got back as invalid....

Of course, trying to make this work, out of a hotel, is a PITA. It's sad
that everyone feels you must submit to a legal agreement before using
their net.

This bug entry CLOSED via a natted - 2 router - to hotel gw over
wireless.

Had to disable named to do it, but...
