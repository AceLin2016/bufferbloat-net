I am getting 80% packet loss on my attempt to get a 3.3-rc4-3 working at
all\
on encrypted wireless. the icmpv6 errors are another problem entirely\
I'd expect.

## History

Perhaps related, but I noticed this change recently in openwrt trunk for
ICMPv6:

https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/30727/trunk

In wireless testing in trunk, there was also a patch to ath9k that
reduced tx bufs to 32 I think. I can't seem to find it at the moment
though:

yea, I wondered where the txqueuelen change came from...

I've gone way beyond that (running sfq by default)... but hmmm......
I'll try ripping that out

as for the icmp change, I tried stripping that out to no real effect...

1.  Allow essential incoming IPv6 ICMP traffic\
    config rule\
    option name Allow-ICMPv6-Input\
    option src \*\
    option proto icmp\
    option limit 1000/sec\
    option family ipv6\
    option target ACCEPT

<!-- -->

1.  Allow essential forwarded IPv6 ICMP traffic\
    config rule\
    option name Allow-ICMPv6-Forward\
    option src \*
2.  option dest \*\
    option proto icmp\
    option limit 1000/sec\
    option family ipv6\
    option target ACCEPT

For reference I am way beyond fiddling with txqueuelen

This is actually against the rc4-3 release, not the rc5

I am aware that powersave mode does weird things to ping, but the phone
does not access the internet worth beans and pinging it has results
like:

Well, the good news is 3.3rc5-1 is not exhibiting the problem when at
2.4ghz,with crypto.\
pings are respectable, performance on the phone itself is good...

The bad news is that this is a highly simplified test setup rather than
an attempted deployment,\
and I'm not going to have time to attempt recreating the deployment.

as far as I know this was only a bug in 3.3rc4.
