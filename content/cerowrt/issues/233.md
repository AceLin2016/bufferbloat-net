{{< issue_description >}}
When I am in this hotel, where DNS (and most packets) are blocked
off-net until I click through a captive portal, BIND 9 will not resolve
any names, and my laptop cannot either.

I propose that some checking script be in place which does a DNS lookup
to the ge00-provided name server addresses, and if it returns data, then
BIND be configured normally. If this look-up fails, BIND should be
configured as a forwarder to the dhcp-provided name servers.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-08-22T14:25:05" author="Michael Graff" >}}
Evan and I have a patch to BIND 9 that may help here, a lot. Evan can
likely get it to you. I recommend just using it in this release, and if
needed make it a knob later.

The problem is that BIND 9 issues upstream queries with recursion
desired = 0, and then we get back strange answers from captive, walled
garden DNS servers which habitually lie.

The "fix" is to just take what we get. It's either right (in which case
validation may work) or bad (in which case it will not).

Possibly one should add UI options to enable/disable validation and
enable/disable "just forward to my ISP" options for BIND.

I'd like more detail on this patch, and to get it into rc6, if it makes
sense. I would hope that the vast majority of users are not testing in
hotels, however...

I didn't intend to test it in a hotel, but it was where I was living
while in California last week. :)

I'd ask Evan if he can send it along.

I have this (1 line) patch, somewhere in my mail, but can't find it
anywhere, nor remember who it came from.

what is stopping this patch from ending up in bind itself? Carrying out
of tree patches is no fun.

The patch will end up in BIND as a switch you can turn on, eventually.
It's not really proper pinky-raised DNS, so I don't think it should be
on by default with no ability to turn it off.

Even weirder, sometimes I see bind work; but most recently mostly not.

I set up the forwarder's file manually, and it worked some of the time.
Needs to be setable in a bind UI
