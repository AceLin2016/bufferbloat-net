\[On 20 Jul 2012, Jim Gettys submitted this report. It was initially
numbered Bug \#404. In an unsuccessful attempt to remove list spam, I
deleted the original ticket, but have re-entered it here -reb\]

If I reconfigure the router to use a different channel, and then tell
the router to save and apply the new setting, the radio channel gets
changed, but after the reconfiguration, I can't get an IP address (until
I reboot the router).

Sorta seems like something needs to be restarted that isn't.

I had similar problems changing the ESSID from Luci; the change was
applied in the file, but afterwards, I couldn't get an IP address until
I rebooted.

Hi Jim. I had exactly the same with 3.3.8-10. Had to revert to\
previous build. Restarting dhcp didn't help. Bad fw rules perhaps?
