&gt; This patch updates qos-scripts to support fair traffic sharing
using the\
&gt; SFQ with external classifiers method.  It also corrects a bug in
the\
&gt; unsupported ESFQ method already used by qos-scripts.  (ESFQ:\
&gt; http://fatooh.org/esfq-2.6/ only updated to 2.6.24, it was switched
to\
&gt; an SFQ patch after that and not updated since 2008)\
&gt;\
&gt; A class can be forced to use SFQ, and an external classifier added
like\
&gt; this:\
&gt;\
&gt; config class "Normal"\
&gt;         option avgrate     10\
&gt;         option priority    30\
&gt;         option packetdelay 100\
&gt;         option limitrate   94\
&gt; \#       option qdisc      "sfq perturb 2"\
&gt; config class "Normal\_up"\
&gt; \#       option filter   "protocol all flow hash keys src divisor
1024"\
&gt; config class "Normal\_down"\
&gt; \#       option filter   "protocol all flow hash keys dst divisor
1024"\
&gt;\
&gt; Using these options, the user needs to load cls\_flow before
qos-scripts\
&gt; starts.\
&gt;\
&gt; I've got more information here:\

&gt;\
&gt;\
&gt; This has been tested on r23914.\

I am bumping this so we can get a current patch.\

We need some fair queuing and AQM to do anything sane. Current scripts
are totally insane and need revisiting from absolute first principles.
