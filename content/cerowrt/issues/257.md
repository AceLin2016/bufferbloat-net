I added the following definitions to my main bind9 dns server\
so I could test the bind9 services on the routers.

(I note I added the lab IN A an AAAA records later to no avail)

lab IN NS ns1.lab.bufferbloat.net.\
IN NS ns2.lab.bufferbloat.net.\
IN A 149.20.63.18\
IN AAAA 2001:4f8:3:203::2\
ns1.lab IN A 149.20.63.18\
IN AAAA 2001:4f8:3:203::2\
ns2.lab IN A 149.20.63.19\
IN AAAA 2001:4f8:3:203::13

Then I set up acls, a slave zone, etc, on the router, to make it
work...\
theoretically. However, if I only enabled the internal view, I got this:

Aug 30 11:43:33 shipka named\[7177\]: zone lab.bufferbloat.net/IN:
refresh: non-authoritative answer from master 2001:4f8:3:203::2\#53
(source ::\#0)

and no slaves file is created. OK. So I try to setup the glue record and
NOT cache the domains...

root@shipka:/etc/bind\# host www.lab.bufferbloat.net\
Host www.lab.bufferbloat.net not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)\
root@shipka:/etc/bind\# host lab.bufferbloat.net\
Host lab.bufferbloat.net not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)\
root@shipka:/etc/bind\# Aug 30 11:43:33 shipka named\[7177\]: zone
lab.bufferbloat.net/IN: refresh: non-authoritative answer from master
2001:4f8:3:203::2\#53 (source ::\#0)

so I set up the external view and now I'm happy except I don't write the
slaves file -

except that I get this:

Aug 30 11:54:33 shipka named\[7259\]: transfer of
'lab.bufferbloat.net/IN' from 2001:4f8:3:203::2\#53: connected using
2001:4f8:3:36:208:54ff:fedb:40ec\#52884\
Aug 30 11:54:33 shipka named\[7259\]: transfer of
'lab.bufferbloat.net/IN' from 2001:4f8:3:203::2\#53: failed while
receiving responses: REFUSED\
Aug 30 11:54:33 shipka named\[7259\]: transfer of
'lab.bufferbloat.net/IN' from 2001:4f8:3:203::2\#53: Transfer completed:
0 messages, 0 records, 0 bytes, 0.002 secs (0 bytes/sec)

and I still want the internal views to be split so I can have 172.x
reverse resolve....

and ultimately I want to be able to sign this whole shmeer....
