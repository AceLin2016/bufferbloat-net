CeroWRT is great as it provides split networks: se00, sw00, sw10, gw00,
gw10... instead of the common pattern of bridge all together.

This is great, but imposes few problems, such as UPnP being only visible
in their network. Another problem that would be great to be solved is
how to cover more area using CeroWRT bound by Ethernet (as opposed to
WDS).

Some houses are big or have thick brick walls that blocks wireless
propagation. To solve this using different routers will help. Since
gigabit ethernet is way faster and more reliable than extending the
range using WDS, it is desired to use it to link different routers.

It is expected that if you have multiple routers with the same SSID, if
they use a single DHCP IP pool, the devices can migrate transparently
from router to router, without loosing connectivity. Usually this is
done by linking the routers using their LAN, giving them the same WiFi
SSID and disabling the DHCP in all but one router.

However given CeroWRT multi-network scheme, it will break transparent
migration across routers with the same SSID. If one device connected to
sw00 (say IP: 172.30.42.93) on main router, then walks towards the
signal of the secondary router it will need to be reconnected because
the flow from the main router to secondary doesn't happen through sw00,
but se00, that doesn't know the .93 IP! The device would then reconnect
with an IP within range 1-30 (se00).

I've been thinking about alternatives, none of them is great and would
like your ideas. Likely integrate the result as a new feature of
CeroWRT.
