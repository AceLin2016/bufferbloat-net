Probably the biggest new thing in rc8 is going to be all the interfaces
will be running some non-default qdisc by default, or so I hope.

To start off with wireless - there is no qdisc that is really appropo at
this time. Work is in progress towards abstracting out enough stuff to
make an aggregatable qdisc but I expect that work to take 6 months or
more longer to even show a plausible result, much less

Of the choices available... SFQ has properties that are pretty
compatible with packet aggregation in wireless-n, and does not do too
much harm to wireless-g (or so I think), and I have been using that for
several months now with no other ill effects noted. The usually
less-than-desirable property of SFQ is that it can bunch up to 16
packets up and not be entirely 'fair' that way. This is basically what
we want, actually, when we aggregate packets.

I am explicitly filtering out multicast macs and making sure they end up
in the VO queue so they don't confuse SFQ as much.(presently multicast
in MAC80211 gets figured out after it hits the driver, rather than
before it hits the qdiscs)

I also have mods in there to do better DSCP level classification (since
rc5), and if I can finish it, I have an 'ANT' classifier as well that
I'll stick in there. The net effect of these two classifiers is to toss
more real-time requiring (but short) stuff into the VI queue. It's my
hope that I can push both the dscp and ant things upstream after rc8 is
done, also. So what I think is going to happen on the gw00 gw10 sw00
sw10 interfaces is 3 SFQ qdiscs on VI, BE, and BK - and I might either
do pfifo\_head\_drop on VO or QFQ + head drop on VO. gw01 and g11 I
haven't decided on as presently packets can't be aggregated there and
I'm in love with QFQ....

As for ethernet, I've proven that I can run QFQ and QFQ + RED at rates
that seem thus far indistinguishable from pfifo\_fast from a cpu
perspective.

so either they aren't working... or they are pretty fast... more to come
on that.

So the internal ethernet interface is going to be QFQ for sure, but I
don't see much point in red there at present. The external interface...
well... let me do that in a different bug.....

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-12-08T00:20:52" author="David Taht" >}}
This is the 6th in a series of mails doing a post-mortem and rethink\
of what is in cerowrt.

Basically I think the 2.4ghz spectrum is beyond hope. Everywhere I've\
been there are dozens of radios all on all the channels available, all\
competing, all interfering, and the difference in performance results\
I get minute to minute, hour to hour varies so wildly that in order to\
get a good picture of how basic 2.4ghz performance worked I had to go\
to remote valley in france where there was no competing signals to\
deal with.

There I got pretty equivalent results between 2.4ghz and 5. The rest\
of the time, not so much.

As for wireless-g vs n, the current architecture of the mac80211 stack\
buries packet aggregation so deeply within it that the two\
technologies are very incompatible. It also bothers me that management\
frames are buried so deeply, too.

The only places I've been this year that had a functional wireless\
network, rigorously divided up the SSIDs into g, n, ipv4 and ipv6\
specific parts, and were using Cisco hardware.

I don't see the need to have separate SSIDs for 4 and 6, but I think\
g+QFQ, and n+SFQ might do better in the general case on an AP.

QFQ would work well on client machines, particularly with n, to break\
up packet bursts more sanely into multiple streams. SFQ, less so. I'd\
rather pursue QFQ on the clients as it better 'shreds' competing\
bursts. I'd like others to play with it too.

and in all cases getting to where something BQL-like + Time in Queue\
on top of those two techniques will help most of all,\
but better feedback loops and means of determining bandwidth\
differences between destinations are kind of required.

And doing MUCH better classification into the hardware queues would be\
good, too.

So in the next release of cerowrt I'm planning on having a separate\
n-only or g-only SSID available on the 5ghz channel, and\
to experiment with the above qdiscs. I sort of have some major ANT and\
DSCP specific classifier code that I plan to polish up.

as for BQL and Time in Queue, that work is only just beginning and I\
hope to track it closely. As to how to make it apply to wireless,\
I look forward to the engineering debate(s). It's a ton of work.

note, that I do try on occasion to capture stuff into the bug tracker\
When you see something like \[\#305\] in the subject\
or cerowrt ccd, it goes there...

That said, I have to not surprise people with that 'feature'.

I'm not in a position to build kernels for anything but ubuntu and
cerowrt at the moment, although fq\_codel has landed in operwrt, (doing
builds for tons of arches)

The last important patch for fq\_codel landed in net-next a few minutes
ago.

So if anyone out there is running any other linux derivative that is
linux 3.3 based, I'd love it if they could get codel and fq\_codel
running on it and get a build out there for others to try.

aqm is not just for routers anymore

Unfortunately I don't think Gentoo counts. :-)

However, my tests using my Gentoo-flavoured PowerBook firewall are very
promising indeed. With the bandwidth restricted to 4M/1M and several
torrents running, ordinary HTTP traffic (including DNS etc.) still got
through reliably and smoothly with fq\_codel, and less so with plain
codel or plain sfq.

With the torrent client set up to restrict the bandwidth of TCP
connections explicitly, but let uTP run freely, there was an interesting
quirk. With no AQM/FQ specified, a single HTTP download was able to
outcompete dozens of uTP streams and receive a varying but relatively
large share of the bandwidth - a clear sign that uTP's efforts to fade
into the background are in fact effective. With fq\_codel, the HTTP
download received roughly equal bandwidth to one of the faster members
of the uTP set. With plain codel, the results were much less convincing,
as the HTTP download often stalled - it's not immediately clear to me
why that might be.

Most striking is the behaviour of fq\_codel when downloading a typical
web page with many constituent files, particularly images. These files
download neatly and smoothly in parallel, just like you would expect
them to if you knew nothing about networking. It's **beautiful**. SFQ
has the same basic effect, but with fq\_codel it seems to be more
robust.

I have yet to run any successful tests with QFQ. With the vanilla kernel
I got zero traffic as soon as I turned it on. With net-next I might get
better results.
