{{< issue_description >}}
The samba in OpenWrt is antique and unmaintained.

Since we likely need it to help bridge between multiple sub-networks for
Windows clients, this is bad... And doesn't support modern
authentication methods for window.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-11-28T08:26:17" author="Dave Täht" >}}
The latest versions of samba are at 3.61, and the resulting software\
per-requisites and binaries are huge.

What can be stripped out remains to\
be seen.

There was a great deal of churn in the samba 3.0.X package of late,\
which just stabilized, but I'm unsure if that will help any.

All we need is working wins support but whether that can be made to\
work with the most current windows remains to be seen.

This work on 3.6 and the ongoing work on the 3.0 release are very
encouraging.

I have folded the latest work from the openwrt universe into the
ceropackages repository.

I have stuck this version into cerowrt by default and updated luci to be
able to use it.

As for this being a correct configuration - no, needs work.

samba 364 is in the current releases.

smbpasswd will crash if you don't have an equivalent user in
/etc/passwd, but that's about it. Well, wins needs to be enabled.
