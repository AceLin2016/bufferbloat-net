Hi all!

I try to build cerowrt with script "build\_cero.sh init" but this script
give me an error:

## History

The current version of cerowrt is not independently buildable with that
script.

I will be producing an improved version and separate patches in the
rc7-smoketest\
series. Sorry, but due to the chaos in the linux kernel.org process and
my own\
pending vacation, and recent travel to france, things got
disorganized....

Please come see me (today) and I can get you a working build in about 10
minutes\
that doesn't use that script.

At present cerowrt is VERY specific to the wndr3700v2, specifically the
atheros (ath9k) chipset . I do hope that with some minor effort it can
be ported to the routerstation -- but I don't know what's in the
routerboard?

Most of the core changes to the drivers and underlying architecture are
pushed up into openwrt. A description of what's different about cerowrt
in general is in the release notes for rc6.

Hello,

Routerboard contains:\
CPU: Atheros AR7161\
wireless radio can be any ath9k chipset.

But I can try to build because is not working for me.

Thanks for all information Dave!

I have revised the build instructions to have a note regarding the
kernel.org problem and a workaround, AND have hopefully fixed the script
to be more general.

I do not garuntee anything at this point... but give this a shot.

Meh. There are still a few problems left. I need to push things up and
solve \#113 somehow.

But the above should get you started.

I updated the wiki page and tested the instructions with a fresh ubuntu
install that it **should** work.

It would be good to have a 3rd person duplicate the procedure before we
can call it 'baked'. Jim?

Also I suppose we are getting close to being able to build a vm...

and I have to update that build script to let people build from a tagged
release.

I could build cerowrt-3.3 from the steps mentioned at\
http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/Building\_Cerowrt\_on\_your\_own_machine

There are slight changes required in the build\_cero.sh, cero\_config
and instructions.\
The required diffs are attached.
