Why is it, that despite trying to get testers to be interested in - for
example, trying babel and mesh routing on the extra interfaces... or
configuring their own web server... running dns and dnssec... or playing
with the cerowrt web proxy... or doing network bandwidth and latency
under load tests... or reporting back on the quality of the wifi
interface... playing with ahcp... or seeing the utility of having a
guest interface... etc?

I'm not whining, I just had hoped we'd tried hard enough to encourage
folk to do things differently with what we were trying to do and
documented, here:

http://jupiter.lab.bufferbloat.net/cerowrt/about.html

http://jupiter.lab.bufferbloat.net/cerowrt/features.html

To get peeps fiddling with that stuff rather than fitting the whole
smeer into their pre-conceptions of how to do this stuff.

So I'm willing to try and address all these 'it's not the same as a
normal router' issues, but trying to change at least a few of those
preconceptions along the way would be helpful. Ideas?

Wonderful topics.

Perhaps it would be good to finish the docs, so one can understand how
this new-to-me mesh networking works?

I follow http://jupiter.lab.bufferbloat.net/cerowrt/mesh.html and get a
pretty page, but the "how to" page of
http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/Mesh is empty.

heh. Very good point. Some of this doc was in capetown...

but I will get cracking on release and experimenters notes ASAP.

If you tell me what I should be testing and what indicates
success/failure, I'll be happy to report.

>I don't even know how to configure the QoS stuff (although the docs
tell me I should) but that is inexperience. If I had it tweaked
properly, I still don't know how to quantify the improvement other than
anecdotal human-based observations of better or worse.

The principal (and lame) test we use is latency under load - lots of
up/downloads while pinging elsewhere.

>The mesh stuff is interesting, and I have two wndr3700v2 boxes now
so it is potentially useful even) but once done, I don't know what to DO
with it. &gt;What do you want tested? How can it be measured and
quantified as "working" beyond just playing?

I put up preliminary doc on the mesh stuff on the web site. I'll settle
for documentation and tools that get it 'working' for more people, then
move on to playing. I've internalized ahcp and babel so much that I
can't simply explain the wonders of mesh networking (being able to move
freely between wired and wireless networks with an open ssh connection
for example)

>Same with the bloat. Is there a daemon I can run which measures
something I can report?

>Perhaps we need a long-running measurement and reporting daemon. :)
Or SNMP hooks? I'm willing to install snmpd (which I already have
anyway) and &gt;let it be probed remotely.

Yes we do. We also have netperf getting fired out of xinetd, with
permissions (at least on most machines) on being probed from the lab.
Longer term the plan was to allow snmp via the vpn.

>This is the first OpenWRT box I've ever used, and most of the stuff
I really want (VPNs etc) on the CeroWRT box don't match what a
"standard" OpenWRT &gt;install would use, it seems.

I'm not really sure what you mean here - both strongswan and openvpn are
available via an opkg update; opkg list; opkg install the\_package

More stuff can be built as per your needs. At some point soon I'll have
a one-line build-yer-own-cerowrt script done.

>Specifically, I have a IPv4 /27 and would love to have it exposed to
the UI, or at least know how to configure it on the box.

Openwrt does not use /XX for ipv4 markings, but old style
255.255.255.224. It should be visible in the ui.

>Bridging seems to not work as expected, or at least not work as I
expect it; if I bridge through the UI, and yes it is wired+wireless, the
wired &gt;ends up in the bridge but the wireless does not, but if I use
command-line tools to re-add it (brctl I think it is?) it does add it
until I touch &gt;any interface config.

hmm...

How about we have a voice/irc chat and run through some stuff together?
Everybody lives on \#bufferbloat on chat.freenode.net - but I'd like to
chat via voice, via skype....

One number I can report, but it is not especially useful...

After switching away from the Xen-hosted NetBSD router (yes, virtual
routers FTW!) my next hop latency as measured by the Ripe NCC Atlas
probe dropped from about 1.95ms average to 1.09ms average.

This is probably because it has to travel through less wires overall.

oh, and the specific test I was hoping to get done soon was a suite of
isc's named benchmarks run against both bind and dnsmasq.
