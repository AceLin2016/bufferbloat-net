{{< issue_description >}}
Trying to edit a firewall rule in the LuCI gui such as one of the
defaults with a Destination of "Device:0.0.0.0/0:80 53 433 873" is
impossible.

The GUI's javascript form validation rejects the port form field because
it is not a single number but has spaces in it.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-08-29T20:38:59" author="Dave Täht" >}}
Our configuration of /etc/config/firewall predates LOTs of changes to
the firewall interfaces. I don't think luci kept up - and I don't think
the firewall rule generator uses multiport matches, for this sort of
thing, either, generating one rule per port entry.

It would be good if the syntax for /etc/config/firewall matched
/etc/config/qos.

I'll look into this deeper in the morning. Thx for testing!

Syncing luci-app-firewall with the current firewall v2r27 features is on
my ToDo but I need to get backfire done first.
