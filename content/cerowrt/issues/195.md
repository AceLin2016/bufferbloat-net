do\_ade accounts for over 22% of the runtime on stuff that stresses the
ethernet driver.

this is trapping on unaligned accesses. from somewhere.

I have not had time to run oprofile on the code of late, but when I was
testing iperf at 100+Mbit per second on ethernet, over ethernet only,
(not over wireless) it was spending 22% of it's time in an unaligned
instruction trap.

I was going to try using netperf, instead, to see if it was a kernel
problem rather than a userspace problem.

oprofile is enabled in the current build and installable as a package. I
forgot to enable the unaligned trap perf monitor, however in the rc1
build.

(This is not a blocker for rc1 of cerowrt). The router runs at wire
speeds at 100Mbit, even with only 4 buffers in the ethernet driver
(however there's a problem with setting that that low, via ethtool, at
gigE speeds, that locks up the port entirely. I'll file a bug on that
shortly, with how to duplicate that exactly, see also the email on the
lists)

ALSO:

Lots of iptables rules, using **multiport** matches (code in my Diffserv
repo) also slowed the router down far more than expected. The new
firewall code doesn't use multiport matches (although they could, I
think, or I have the new syntax wrong), and I haven't had time to verify
what happens with lots of ports in the latest cerowrt builds (I am
opening more ports than usual, so that testing tools can abuse more
stuff, like rsync)

Would certainly like an oprofiling expert to look at this one, again,
using netperf vs iperf to see if it is userspace or not.

I again failed to include the unaligned trap perf counter in rc4
however.

Felix has made enormous progress today in fixing the unaligned
instruction traps.

<nbd> dtaht: i have another idea about the alignment issue \[08:00\]\
<nbd> dtaht: i can try declaring the ip/tcp/udp header struct as
\_\_packed\
<dtaht> hi \[08:01\]\
<dtaht> just pulled into the train station\
<nbd> i think gcc automatically generates unaligned access code then\
<dtaht> don't know how bad the wifi will be\
<dtaht> um, usually\
<dtaht> \_\_packed means that a byte and a 16 bit struct and a byte will
get\
packed together\
<dtaht> which scares me mildly in this case\
<nbd> gcc will not generate any implicit padding \[08:02\]\
<nbd> but it'll also assume that the entire struct is unaligned\
<dtaht> it will?\
<nbd> yes, i only figured it out by accident\
<nbd> when i was profiling ath9k, i noticed the descriptor access
functions\
were showing up with high percentage points \[08:03\]\
<dtaht> ok. I guess I'm going to need more pedestals for godlike
behavior...\
<nbd> then i looked a the assembly and noticed that it didn't do aligned
32\
bit access\
<dtaht> hmm\
<nbd> when i did \_*packed*\_aligned(4), it started doing 32 bit access
again\
<dtaht> this sounds like either a brilliant hack, or an instant system
crash.\
\[08:04\]\
<dtaht> I mean, normal people don't go NEAR the ip header code. EVER.\
<nbd> system crash is pretty much impossible with this\
<dtaht> but I concede you are not normal in any respect\
<dtaht> the thing is\
<nbd> because the struct was carefully written to not rely on implicit
padding\
<nbd> because implicit padding is highly arch specific\
<dtaht> I'm on a train, and wifi is spotty\
<dtaht> do you need me to get you setup on huchra, or can I reuse
andrews\
build environent, or what? \[08:05\]\
<nbd> i don't need huchra right now\
<nbd> i'm compiling on my laptop anyway\
<dtaht> ok, well, I do want to be able to get the same results as you
\[08:06\]\
<dtaht> did you think andrews's fixes to the TU stuff was worthwhile?\
<nbd> i don't think it'll have significant effects at this point
\[08:07\]\
<nbd> especially not with the max retries override\
<dtaht> I guess my core question is, can I get a rollup patch from you
that is\
sane, of all this stuff, so I don't have to replicate the bits flying\
in loose formation?\
<dtaht> ok.... (That was a dubious sounding ok....)\
<nbd> this TU stuff is just a heuristic for determining the number of
retries\
\[08:08\]\
<nbd> minimum retries per stage is 2 anyway\
<dtaht> actually, better, could andrew and I get a rollup patch - on the
bug\
report 216 - of where you are at. Hopefully the next train I get on\
will be less laggy.\
<dtaht> and I can get a build done\
<nbd> so if you cap the maximum number of retries, then there is only
little\
effect that this stuff can have\
<dtaht> hell, might even just flash a router on the train\
<dtaht> and take a stab at what the heck is wrong with STA mode

-   dtaht chortles\
    <nbd> wow\
    <nbd> cpu load went from 75% to 57% \[08:09\]\
    <dtaht> for 'normal' firewall at 100Mbit?\
    <nbd> yes\
    <nbd> and i only changed two lines ;)\
    <nbd> well, i might need to change a third line for udp ;)\
    <dtaht> dude, if you care to rewrite the rules a bit to use the
    interface+\
    syntax a little smarter, and get multiport working right, I think\
    you'll finally be able to drive this thing at 300Mbit for real,
    from\
    the gige port. \[08:10\]\
    <dtaht> I would note I would be REALLY SCARED of that change and
    want to slam\
    a lot of verification streams through it....\
    <nbd> i'm 95% confident that this change won't break anything
    \[08:11\]\
    <nbd> well, 99%\
    <nbd> i knew an idea like this would show up if i waited long enough
    for it ;)\
    \[08:12\]\
    <dtaht> heh
-   dtaht applaudes\
    <dtaht> (how do you spell applaud in french? German?) \[08:13\]\
    <nbd> applaudieren\
    <nbd> (= to applaud)
-   dtaht applaudieren\
    <dtaht> um, to what other protocols could this apply? Across the
    board?\
    <dtaht> does it work with ipv6? \[08:14\]\
    <nbd> i added ip, udp and tcp\
    <nbd> ipv6 can be fixed the same way too\
    <nbd> but there are still some remaining unaligned exceptions\
    <dtaht> s/can/needs to be/\
    <nbd> so i can probably improve things even more if i track them
    down\
    <dtaht> I am setting up a testlab at isc with native ipv6, next
    week, I hope
-   dtaht makes puppy dog eyes at nbd to prioritize making ipv6 just as
    happy as\
    ipv4 \[08:15\]\
    <nbd> already did that \[08:16\]\
    <nbd> there's still 7 unaligned exceptions per packet \[08:17\]\
    <nbd> at least with icmp\
    <nbd> ah, nice. debugfs allows me to force the kernel to print a
    stack trace\
    on every unaligned exception \[08:20\]\
    <nbd> good thing i compiled my kernel with debug info\
    <dtaht> way to go\
    <nbd> ok, so the checksum still needs fixing\
    <dtaht> csum\_partial? \[08:25\]\
    <dtaht> I'd seen multiple people hack that up to do the right thing\
    <dtaht> never understood why there wasnt a gnerica
    csum\_partial\_unaligned\
    people could use
-   dtaht notes train is sucking up tcp \[08:26\]\
    <dtaht> I have to switch trains shortly

<nbd> they didn't add an unaligned version, because there are only very
few\
devices that have both crappy ethernet chips with alignment limitations\
and inefficient unaligned access\
<nbd> so they were probably hoping to never need crap like that\
<dtaht> nbd: still, felix, I've seen a modified csum\_partial go by at
least 3\
times for a couple arches, and it bugs me it's not in there...\
\[08:32\]\
<nbd> right now i'm fixing ip\_fast\_csum\
<nbd> which is responsible for 4 out of 7 unaligned exceptions
\[08:33\]\
<npmapn> I've read about the progress you've made. \[08:34\]\
<npmapn> This is amazing!\
<nbd> two other exceptions are in ipv4\_pkt\_to\_tuple\
<nbd> also easy to fix\
<dtaht> yea, I immediately spotted that csum\_partial thing last time.
Been\
there. Done that. :) Didn't realize it was also doing that many other\
places that were busted....\
<dtaht> it has been a very insanely productive couple days. Meeting
andrew was\
amazing.... Then the guy that wrote the original mac80211\
surfaced... And nbd is back and restored to life, after chasing girls\
for weeks in Indonesia... :) \[08:35\]\
<npmapn> That always helps. ;)\
<nbd> btw. this is the diffstat of my alignment change (including
checksum\
fix): \[08:41\]\
<nbd> 6 files changed, 23 insertions(+), 17 deletions(-)\
<nbd> currently building it for a quick test run\
<dtaht> sounds worth polishing and pushing to mainline\
<nbd> no\
<nbd> definitely not\
<nbd> it makes everything not suffering from this issue perform worse
\[08:42\]\
<nbd> and there's no good way around that\
<nbd> so it'll stay an openwrt specific hack\
<dtaht> ok\
<dtaht> judging from the results you got on the first pass, I'm
expecting to\
be really impressed with this next pass\
<dtaht> :) \[08:44\]\
<npmapn> This set of patches will stay in the ar71xx patches directory,
I\
suppose.\
<nbd> well, the first one already took care of most of the issues\
<nbd> so the second patch will only be a minor improvement on top of
that\
<dtaht> well, csum\_partial back in the old days used to be a nightmare\
<dtaht> but I'm REALLY dating myself in even talking about it \[08:45\]\
<dtaht> (we're talking an embedded board I worked on in the mid 80s)\
<nbd> :)\
<dtaht> racal-interlan something or other\
<dtaht> offloaded the entire tcp stack into like 320k on a pci board\
<dtaht> no... It was ISA - 16 bit \[08:46\]\
<dtaht> but at the time, it was impossible to run tcp/ip well under dos

-   dtaht pulls out a few gray hairs\
    <dtaht> ok, I gotta switch trains now \[08:47\]\
    <dtaht> add some notes to the unaligned bug report? The patch
    maybe?\
    <dtaht> will be back online in 90 minutes\
    <nbd> yay, no more unaligned exceptions in the hotpath \[08:48\]\
    <dtaht> got a number for cpu usage at 100mbit? \[08:49\]\
    <dtaht> got 2 minutes before I get off train\
    <nbd> 55%\
    <dtaht> can you test and drive gige?\
    <nbd> later\
    <nbd> my current test endpoint only does 100\
    <dtaht> I have 3 routers on me \[08:50\]\
    <dtaht> It would be gas to run 'em on the next train\
    <dtaht> gotta go

Subject: some ar71xx tests \[\#195\]\
To: Andrew McGregor <andrewmcgr@gmail.com>, Felix Fietkau
<nbd@openwrt.org>

I built a version of cerowrt from openwrt head, in andrew's dir with
netperf\
installed by default...

Going with the defaults:

netperf -H the\_other\_router from\_one\_router

I get 143Mbit

Going router-router over gigE (lan to wan), with tcp\_low\_latency
turned on,\
on both sides, with:

Recv Send Send\
Socket Socket Message Elapsed\
Size Size Size Time Throughput\
bytes bytes bytes secs. 10\^6bits/sec

87380 16384 16384 60.00 218.20

so tcp\_low\_latency looks like a win with westwood+

My laptop doesn't do gigE, so can't test that here.

All these tests are with the default firewall rules for cerowrt, and
nat\
turned off on the one master router... and ethernet buffers of **4**,
and\
txqueuelen of 8.

For giggles, I did a test with cubic:

root@OpenWrt:/proc/sys/net/ipv4\# fg\
netperf -l 60 -H 172.30.42.33\
Recv Send Send\
Socket Socket Message Elapsed\
Size Size Size Time Throughput\
bytes bytes bytes secs. 10\^6bits/sec

87380 16384 16384 60.00 228.26

And last, with cubic, and firewall rules turned off:

gw.home.lan (172.30.42.33) port 0 AF\_INET\

87380 16384 16384 60.00 257.75

I'll try diffserv again in the morning.

interestingly, the tcp stream going from laptop (100Mbit) - router
(gige) router only has about a \~5ms latency for ping

the udp\_stream test:

Just to keep bug tracking..

I pulled from 27917.

I don't see any commits that could have caused this breakage, except
maybe\
that I'm building against 2.6.39.3, and may have differences in my
config\
file from yours that are important.

could I encourage you to hop on huchra?

Also I'm curious if YOUR ethernet build showed this:

T\
root@OpenWrt:\~\# dmesg | grep eth0\
eth0: Atheros AG71xx at 0xb9000000, irq 4\
eth0: unable to find MII bus on device 'rtl8366s'\
eth0: Atheros AG71xx at 0xba000000, irq 5\
eth0: unable to find MII bus on device 'rtl8366s'

I thought I was building from the same .config as you with support for
the\
1000hz and no\_hz options - the above looks like a faster clock tick
problem\
to me... but you should have seen that too.

So I can revert to 2.6.39.2, revert all that

and/or restart from scratch from my patch set (Which only touches one
tiny\
bit of the eth driver and NOTHING of the wireless driver) But with a
little\
data perhaps that won't be neccessary.

I'll stick around here a while longer, cleaning up, and getting a
router\
from thursday online...

After I get some sleep.

I don't know if ethernet was working, I never checked.

I was using 2.6.39.2 however, so I suspect an upstream change is causing
the\
patch to not apply. It's not big, you could put it in by hand easily\
enough. The last chunk you could also change the other case in that if\
statement to something smaller, although that won't happen on a WNDR3700

About to get on a plane to NZ, so I'll be out of circulation for around
36\
hours.

I don't see any commits that could have caused this breakage, except

that I'm building against 2.6.39.3, and may have differences in my
config\
file from yours that are important.

could I encourage you to hop on huchra?

Also I'm curious if YOUR ethernet build showed this:

T\
root@OpenWrt:\~\# dmesg | grep eth0\
eth0: Atheros AG71xx at 0xb9000000, irq 4\
eth0: unable to find MII bus on device 'rtl8366s'\
eth0: Atheros AG71xx at 0xba000000, irq 5\
eth0: unable to find MII bus on device 'rtl8366s'

I thought I was building from the same .config as you with support for
the\
1000hz and no\_hz options - the above looks like a faster clock tick
problem\
to me... but you should have seen that too.

So I can revert to 2.6.39.2, revert all that

and/or restart from scratch from my patch set (Which only touches one
tiny\
bit of the eth driver and NOTHING of the wireless driver) But with a
little\
data perhaps that won't be neccessary.

I'll stick around here a while longer, cleaning up, and getting a
router\
from thursday online...

After I get some sleep.\

I would really like it if someone from a different time zone and
sleeping\
schedule\
were to download the latest wndr3700v2 development build from here:

http://huchra.bufferbloat.net/~andrewm/cerowrt/

I hope this build finishes up the last of the truly epic adventure that
has\
taken place on bug:

http://www.bufferbloat.net/issues/216

If it works, do play with netperf 2.5.0 on the wireless interface.

I note that the fixes to \#195 seem to have (maybe) messed up the
ethernet\
interface - or the change to a faster clock or tickless or 2.6.39.3 vs\
.2.... OR It may be the router I have on me!

So let us know on this email (bug reporting interface is cc'd)

That's all the news from tent \#34. Good night, and good luck.

1.  The unrecognisable ethernet port problem exists on more than one
    router, so it wasn't my hardware, as I hoped
2.  For my next series of tests, I am first reducing the clock to 100HZ,
    and staying tickless. My best guess as to the source of this problem
    is something hard coded in the init routine for the phy.

I shan't document what I'll do next as it's pretty obvious the bisecting
I'd need to do, nor, do I know, what the real effect of a 1000HZ vs
100HZ clock is on a tickless system, anymore.

I so love it when I guess right.

100HZ clock + tickless + 2.6.39.3... just works.

I have a backlog of other patches that needed to land and a ton of src
to clean up, but we're back in business.

OK, so the ethernet seems a great deal faster than it was, and I will
start doing comprehensive testing vs the factory firmware by the
weekend.

Is there an OpenWRT build containing the patch that I can try?

We are getting absolutely spectacular ethernet performance out of this
puppy now.
