1\) luci-app-ntpc - seems to pull in ntpclient. Or something else is.

ntpclient is obsolete as\
ntpd -g from either the ntpd or ntpd-ssl package will do the right
thing,\
even more so than ntpdate.

It would be nice to be able to edit ntp.conf from the gui, instead.

2\) PPOE is borked in the gui, if you add ppoe later, you get luci
crashing because there\
is no ppp tab. (probably my bug, I just needed to build ppoe and a luci
for ppoe in)

3\) It would be more consistent to use whatever/24 to denote the ipv4
routes in system-&gt;routes,\
as that is how ipv6 shows up, and you save a column.

re ipv6: You can safely filter out the fe80:: routes to reduce the noise
level

Protocol to show up in that column would be good, instead.

/etc/iproute2/rt\_proto could list babel support (42), and a larger list
of\
real protocols, to get automatic number-&gt;reality translation

/etc/iproute2/\* consists of several rather tiny files that are nice to
have.\
I hope whenever the latest iproute shows up we can include them.

I'll gladly file these separately elsewhere, just wanted to capture then
before I went to bed.
