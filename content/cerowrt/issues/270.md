Right now, CeroWrt may, if it has no wired network connection, mesh
automatically with other routers.

The router should warn in some visible (but not too obnoxious way) if it
is running in this mode: e.g.\
a blinking light, and maybe a highlighted text on the status page.

Running meshed if you don't have wired around is fine, but people should
be more easily aware of a router that "just does it right" as CeroWrt
does.

Well, it doesn't 'quite' do it just right. You need to setup at least
one AHCP server node somewhere on the network to supply leases, ntp, and
dns information.

That said, some indicator would be useful in some way.

I added support for additional user to kernel space led controls in the
rc8 build. How to use them... dunno. Yet.
