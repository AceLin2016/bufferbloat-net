There is a downside, but I'd like savor the above commit for a few hours
at least.

This requires iproute 3.0 or later, QFQ in the kernel, probably needs
BQL, and doesn't\
quite work well enough over the LFN for my taste... but it was quite
awesome otherwise.

At sub 70 ms RTTs this does mildly better - 3.5mbit upload vs 2.8, which
is close enough\
to 'benchmarker-proof' for me. At the same time I have to retry this in
the same\
test enviroment as I was doing earlier...

Meh. I set machines to the desired 256 value rather than 8, and the
script blows up... hopefully\
just a bug. It takes forever to load without batch mode. With batch mode
it's 100x faster, but\
has to feed from a 1.6 Mbyte file...

The biggest flaw in this is that you can accumulate one heck of a lot of
acks before red even thinks about starting to maybe kick in, so
downloads can starve uploads, and/or acks get seriously delayed in queue
while FQ is happening elsewhere.

I rewrote the qdisc generation script from shell to C and that portion
of it completes in ms now rather than minutes.

the tc parser does pretty well in bulk mode, but that's the bottleneck
now.

And I recently discovered that GSO on the e1000e was enabled by default,
even at 100Mbit and below.

TSO gets disabled. Not GSO.

Sigh. What this does to an algorithm that kind of expects 1500 byte\
packets, at MOST, or a qdisc that measures things in bytes, is looking\
rather ugly.
