{{< issue_description >}}
I installed two interior routers. I noticed that the load was always
above 1 on those routers (the exterior gateway was ok), pimd was the
culprit.

I disabled pimd, which doesn't have much use at the moment (since I
don't use IPv6 multicast applications). And as we don't have hnetd atm
to delegate IPv6 prefixes and I'm not bothering to try, this is a theory
as to why pimd is only running away on the interior routers; the
exterior router has global IPv6 addresses.

Attached are dmesg.txt and logread.txt files of the complaints it is
producing.

Actually, pimd is mostly for ipv4 multicast.

I am not seeing any problems here, but my own network is mostly\
running mildly older cero code.
