Given all the bugs on the buglist, I really need to take a couple days
with writing this up, and generate a test plan and write some test
tools, and build an overall test strategy. My plan at the moment is to
take a looooong train ride across canada this week to do this. I'm told
that wifi works periodically on that train, and there is power, but
would like details...

Maybe some additional testing hardware is needed too. I just got a demo

I really need to start seriously working on this, the list has grown too
hard to keep in my head, or test manually.

I need to dump all the kinds of testing I do manually out of my head and
start finding ways to automate them.
