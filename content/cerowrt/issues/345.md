Using CeroWrt 3.3-rc7-5 on WNDR3700v2... I installed without incident,
and was clicking around through the tabs and observed this problem on
the Network ~~<span style="text-align:right;">Firewall</span>~~&gt;
Traffic Rules page. The message says:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This page contains the following errors:\
error on line 261 at column 57: expected '&gt;'\
Below is a rendering of the page up to the first error.\

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2012-04-08T08:25:01" author="Luke H" >}}
I was about to report the same issue - but in my case I am using the
newer build r31204 (Apr 6) with the 3.3.1 kernel. Same error though:

The syntax expected by the web interface and the syntax in the file have
diverged.

On my todo list is to rebuild the firewall rules from scratch to handle
ipv6 and the guest zone and mesh networking concepts well.

If you'd like to take a crack at it, grab the firewall rules file and
put it somewhere,\
take the existing one in an editor (both vi and zile are available)\
and eliminate all the rules, and then re-enter them via the web
interface...

Attached a syntactally correct version, that may or may not be logically
correct.\
I would appreciate testing. It MAY need the /etc/firewall.user file
explicitly included\
and that file needs work too.

I note that the <link>Device naming scheme</link> is designed to make it
possible to create much more effecient firewall rules, but the gui will
not accept the syntax required, so it has a tendency to create\
O (n) sorts of rules that scale really badly.

The original 'dream' of syntax was you'd use the inherent iptables +
pattern match to create a zone.

    iptables -I FORWARD -i g+ -o s+ -g do_some_secure processing
    iptables -I FORWARD -j ACCEPT # default free zone

is about 12 more rules efficient than the default rules generated which
rapidly gets worse with vlans or ipv6 in the mix. (it scales O (n))

Similarly the rules don't sort by traffic pattern but by logic, so the
default openwrt rules currently send everything through an enormous and
unneeded icmp chain instead of first matching on the most common
protocols.

Regrettably a gui programmer hasn't shown up that can do that. Writing a
script for it is straightforward, but then I lose the gui audience.
Alternate solutions are highly desired.

There are also some issues along the lines of bugs \#195 and \#352 .

While we made great progress today towards getting the gui to work and
ipv6 to work, I needed to put up some documentation on what I'd wanted
to do in the first place, which is called <link>CeroWall</link>. I have
ENOTIME to make CeroWall work, but when you look at the default openwrt
firewall rules, the simplicity I describe with this alternative (with a
few clever pattern matches) seems appealing.

The next build (3.3.2-3) will have working firewall rules viewable in
the web browser.

They may not be perfect... and suggestions are highly desired.
