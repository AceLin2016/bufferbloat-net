{{< issue_description >}}
Restarting the network in iscwrt does not restart dhcpd; subsequent
DHCPDISCOVERs are not answered.

Restarting named is less urgent but ought to be done anyway

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-07T21:47:56" author="Dave T채ht" >}}
Given what we now know about rndc and how slow named can be to restart,
perhaps a kinder/gentler way than exists in files/hotplug.d/iface (rndc
reload config?network?) can be used in named-latest, and regardless the
method I put in place there, it needs to be tested.

Similar fix would be a good idea for dhcp, whatever works...
