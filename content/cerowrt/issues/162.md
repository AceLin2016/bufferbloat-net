<dtaht> I see latencies as high as 60ms under load for ping \[12:45\]\
<dtaht> and NEVER a packet loss.\
<dtaht> I think I only set TX\_RETRY down to 2.\
<nbd> yeah, with my patch i still haven't found a decent queue length
limit\
that doesn't hurt aggregation throughput\
<dtaht> There's another RETRY in hardware?\
<nbd> but at least i've been able to keep the non-aggregated latency
low\
without hurting throughput at all\
<dtaht> nbd: you know me, I don't give a F\* about aggregation
throughpt...\
<dtaht> cool \[12:46\]\
<dtaht> that's a start\
<dtaht> I have routers going to the third world... Today.\
<nbd> what TX\_RETRY are you talking about?\
<dtaht> The amount of wireless-n down there is probably non-existent\
<dtaht> -\#define ATH\_TXMAXTRY 13 \[12:47\]\
<dtaht> +\#define ATH\_TXMAXTRY 2\
<dtaht> \#define ATH\_MGT\_TXMAXTRY 4\
<dtaht>\
<dtaht> \#define TID\_TO\_WME\_AC(\_tid) \\\
<dtaht> `@ -542,7 +542,7 `@\
<dtaht> \#define DEFAULT\_CACHELINE 32\
<dtaht> \#define ATH\_REGCLASSIDS\_MAX 10\
<dtaht> \#define ATH\_CABQ\_READY\_TIME 80 /\* % of beacon interval \*/\
<dtaht> -\#define ATH\_MAX\_SW\_RETRIES 10\
<dtaht> +\#define ATH\_MAX\_SW\_RETRIES 2\
<dtaht>\
<nbd> ah\
<nbd> ATH\_TXMAXTRY is unused \[12:48\]\
<nbd> except when using the ath9k rate control module\
<nbd> but that one's crappy anyway\
<nbd> and openwrt doesn't use it\
<dtaht> I figured.\
<nbd> init.c: hw-&gt;max\_rate\_tries = 10;\
<dtaht> How is germany in June? \[12:49\]\
<dtaht> sigh\
<dtaht> too late to change now, but good to know.\
<nbd> germany's nice in june
