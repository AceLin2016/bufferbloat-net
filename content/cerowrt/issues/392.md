{{< issue_description >}}
My router had become very unstable: it would lock up and I would often
try rebooting to no avail. When I say "lock up", I mean I could no
longer send packets via the wireless interfaces (or get a new address
from it); the box would continue to forward packets from another router
just fine.

Specifically, the router has been running 3.3.0-rc6 and is a WNDR3700v2.

On the theory I should try to figure out what happened after CeroWrt had
been up for a long time, I suffered in silence.

Today, in response to mail on the cerowrt mailing list, I finally
noticed that /tmp/log/babeld.log was huge.\
-rw-r-~~r-~~ 1 root root 247936 May 24 12:27 babeld.log

As /tmp is a tmpfs, I suspect that this may be the cause of the
unstableness.

root@gw-main:/tmp/log\# tail babeld.log\

Gives us another clue.

I should have squirreled away a copy of the whole file before nuking it,
but I didn't. /me bad.

As requested by Jim here is the babeld.conf of cerowrt 3.3.2-6 and a
roughly 250Kb log file of babeld complaining.

Switching to quagga eliminates this log file, however the core problem
with the original daemon remains, and the error it was noting may well,
also, remain in the quagga code.
