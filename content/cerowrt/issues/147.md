{{< issue_description >}}
If the router boots up without a WAN connection, it doesn't get a dhcp
address once connected. Needs a reboot.\
udhcpc is up, but not working properly.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-15T18:32:07" author="Srikanth Sundaresan" >}}
Complex. Once the main DHCP server (that gives out the lease) has a
cache, the wan interface is able to get an address.

Behavior is udhcpc polls continuously for a DHCP address when the link
is down. When the link goes up, theory is unless the main router has an
ARP cache for the secondary router, it fails to provide an address.

There are patches that landed in main openwrt and my mailbox over the
last few days that revise link-state negotiation somewhat. They may
help. They may hurt. As extensive QA has already been performed down to
the kernel level, and fiddling with such a complex, critical system at
this late date introduces other risks, I would prefer to not deal with
this one, as it seems hard to reproduce.

unless this proves a serious problem (please, more people duplicate) I
would prefer to remain frozen so that future routers can be updated via
opkg rather than a complete new sysupgrade.

I will look further into this upon the next release of cerowrt and/or
iscwrt.
