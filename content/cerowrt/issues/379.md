{{< issue_description >}}
So I started doing long duration, heavy access tests, driving things\
with my fastest three boxes,\
crypted and unencrypted wireless, and two machines driving through the\
internal ethernet at\
gigE speeds.

after about 200 sec of heavy load, the router resets. Also in the\
general case it becomes hard to get a connection to the webserver for\
(example) streaming audio, and ssh won't start due to the loadavg\
(have to fix that in xinetd), and dns starts acting up and babeld\
stops transmitting routes

Now, this is truly abnormal use - 250+Mbits going through the router\
full time rather than 20Mbit or so.

So far this is ipv4 only. I was mostly testing ipv6 and fairly short\
(60 second) durations and mostly\
ethernet before now.

Things tried:

0\) reducing the watchdog time to reset to 1 second rather than 5. This\
seemed to help somewhat, but I'm going to rule it out.

1\) turning off the qdiscs. This was mildly amusing as I was perturbed\
by seeing ping times go from .2sec to 20 or 30ms on GigE with\
pfifo\_fast. It's been a long time since these puppies were configured\
as drop tail systems.

Anyway, still crashes. So I think we can regard the aqm system as\
solid. Finally.

I do want to turn hoq-sfq off for further tests, tho.

3\) bumping up BQL. Performance improves slightly, still crashes.

4\) Not using the wireless at all. So far it's survived 2000 seconds of\
abuse, pounding 250+Mbit of ipv4 through it,\
from 5 streams from two boxes.

So things point at some interaction with wireless.

theories are:

hostapd can't get enough cpu time to run\
the rngd daemon can't get enough cpu time to run\
we have a memory leak somewhere in the wireless stack

For the longest time I've had this thing running at HZ\_256. Anyway I'm\
going to leave ethernet loaded up overnight, then try wireless all by\
itself for a few hours.

I have other fish to fry right now.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2012-04-30T02:49:22" author="Dave Täht" >}}
Please note: I'm HAPPY to have ethernet working so well. Now that the
traps are gone it should be possible to do decent analysis with
oprofile, and see what, if anything, can be sped up.

I expected trouble with wireless, but didn't have any until today...
because I was doing the engineer thing and testing wireless by itself
(driving it at 90+Mbit), and ethernet by itself, not both together.
Sigh.

I can't quite rule out iptables, and I should probably also test ipv6
under this scenario
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2012-04-30T02:54:49" author="Dave Täht" >}}
another nice thing is tcp\_rr performance is astoundingly good, 823
transactions per second, even with 8 streams beating up the box.
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2012-05-01T07:08:40" author="Robert Bradley" >}}
If you're thinking this is iptables and unaligned-access related, I did
manage to find a couple of unaligned accesses in the nat (not relevant
for wired-&gt;wireless?) and connection-tracking code for TCP. Is it
possible to just rmmod the relevant modules and test without iptables or
AQM tracking the connections? That would save time instead of running
yet another kernel build with educated guesses at patches.
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2012-05-01T09:01:47" author="Dave Täht" >}}
We're back at the point where we can either oprofile (my preferred
method), or just run tests and watch the unaligned traps happen or not.
1/sec is dealable...

As for this problem and patches, there is patch review on the openwrt
list going on...

{{< issue_journal date="2012-05-01T09:07:38" author="Dave Täht" >}}
oh, and to answer your question more directly, I think we have a new
problem here in that it's not been possible to totally saturate this
beast on interrupts before now...

{{< issue_journal date="2012-05-01T10:05:07" author="Robert Bradley" >}}
Yes, the real question was, "How related is this to \#360 and \#371?"
Apart from those two hiding it, I'm not sure we can say it **is**
related.

If it's interrupt-related, I'm going to guess that the lack of
napi\_poll support in the ath9k driver doesn't help. (The Ethernet
driver has it, so you should be able to route LAN-&gt;WAN with no
problems.)

The
[ieee80211\_ops](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/net/mac80211.h#L2112)
struct seems to think it can. I haven't found a driver that uses it yet
- rtl8180 had it
(http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-wireless/msg53741.html) but that got
reverted
(http://git.itanic.dy.fi/?p=linux-stable;a=patch;h=a6d27d2ac89359f84c1a559b5530967ff671d269).

Hey john, I was wondering why napi was so hard on wireless?

It can, mac80211 has support for it, but it's not implemented in the\
driver yet.

see \#385. When it happens, which is REALLY RARE, it's pretty
catastrophic to the streams.

Everything resets.

Easily hit with a hammer on a patch, which I'll do if I get enough
energy. Shouldn't do that tho

I also note that I've been unable to crash it with the 3.3.5-3 build +
codel, which cheers me up, relatively. I haven't tried sfqred.

This is going to require some serial port debugging and brain cells I do
not have at present.

Hi Dave!

I've been watching your progress here for a while. I've recently started
some work using OpenWRT (I know, not the same project), and I'm seeing
crashes there as well, also under heavy load. It runs about 400 seconds
under very heavy load and then just reboots. Watching the serial console
shows no output when the reload occurs, the box simply starts rebooting.
Specifics:

I'm using an alix 2D13 board. I have several and the problem is seen on
all of them.

I'm using very vanilla OpenWRT builds with a near to default
configuration. In fact, I've turned off dnsmasq and the firewall. I have
no QoS configured. This is literally just port to port routing, nothing
else.

I have two of the three ports connected to a Smartbits test device. I'm
sending 64 byte packets between eth0 and eth1. eth2 is not connected.
The tests start at 10% interface load and run for 90 seconds. If the
test passes ( &gt;0.01% packet loss), it increases the load. I see the
following behavior:

10% load passes\
55% load fails\
32.5% load fails\
21.5% load fails\
60 seconds in to the next test the device reboots. This is repeatable
every time.

I guess what I'm getting at is I think perhaps this is an OpenWRT /
kernel problem and not specific to CeroWRT. In fact, there's a recently
opened ticket on OpenWRT that describes something similar, though
details there are sparse:

https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/11882

I'm going to build a few images of OpenWRT to see if I can narrow down
where it started crashing. Previous builds used to pass my entire test
suite (64 bytes - 1500 byte packets). Now I can't get past the 4th
iteration of the first frame size. I suspect the move to kernel 3.3 in
31753 for the alix2 target is the cause. If you're interested I'll
report back my findings.

Adam: that link was quite interesting! Digging into it, if I understand
correctly, the claim is that the lack of read/write memory barriers in
via-rhine.c are the cause of their crashes. I noticed that in CeroWRT,
the ag71xx wired driver has rmb()/wmb() calls, but not the ath9k
wireless driver. It may be worth modifying the ath9k\_ioread32 and
ath9k\_iowrite32 functions to add these as a test, although I would
expect this to only affect multi-core systems.
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2012-08-06T12:00:31" author="Robert Bradley" >}}
Continuing my previous post, here is the patch to add IO memory barriers
to ath9k. There may well be other points where memory barriers would
make sense too if this is really the cause.
