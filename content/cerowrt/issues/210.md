{{< issue_description >}}
If the wan is on gigE and IF you are getting serious network traffic
before you run ethtool, the ring buffer doesn't get updated right, and
you stop getting traffic at 7 packets. Worse, ethtool runs AFTER dhcp,
so you do get a valid ip address, then ethtool -g tx 4 runs and locks up
the card.

This showed up in our testing in the last couple days. You unplug and
replug, it sets up the driver right that time, and life is good, and we
achieve 100+Mbit/sec speeds with VERY low latency.

I can duplicate it every time now, but was faarrrr too tired after
debugging the problem for 2 days straight to figure out where it was,
but I think it should be easy to find.

Basically, the debloat package in cerowrt would trigger it - but only
under those circumstances. Saw it, maybe, rarely, on 100Mbit on the wan
port. It explains a lot - reports of dhcp problems, etc, etc.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-07-16T14:10:43" author="Dave Täht" >}}
Trying just reducing txqueuelen for now, will fix ethtool another day.
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-07-17T04:43:55" author="Dave Täht" >}}
After removing the debloating script entirely, which calls ethtool and
changes txqueuelen, we were able to get from a reliably reproducable
test case (driver died after 7 packets) to where the wan port seemed to
actually work, for one router, in limited testing.

In doing far more extensive testing, I was able to not only crash the
wan port in a little over 500 packets, but actually get an kernel oops,
even **without** fiddling with these parameters. I will upload the oops
later (it was not very revealing regardless).

These routers do have a patch to their mac address creation routine, but
I don't think that is the problem, what I am thinking is that there is a
real & SUBTLE problem in the reset routines (and/or the ring buffer)
that happens when there is lots of other traffic on the wan.

I will look at this MUCH harder after I get caught up on sleep and back
to my own lab.

pointed out by jow (thx!) nbd (double thx!) made a string of commits
wednesday that look very promising to fix this bug. I will attempt a new
build tomorrow morning.

Nope.

Although you can ifconfig down and up and get back in business, this is
the oops I get

The build for this is currently living at:

http://huchra.bufferbloat.net/~cero1/cerowrt-wndr3700-1.0rc2/

Although it fixes nearly all the other outstanding priority 1 bugs, this
one is a showstopper, so I'm cancelling the rc2 release and going on to
rc3 this week.

Data point: On a freshly flashed router with this build, connected via
it's switched port to the wan port of the previously flashed router
(same build), the new router comes up 'green' for it's connection light,
whilst the old router is orange.

Either this means that GigE/100Mbit is not correctly being detected, or
that the switch configuration for the blinkenlights is wrong, or....

Interestingly, I changed the debloat script to change ethtool in this
sequence, rather than the opposite. No oops, but the driver is just as
hung. I also noticed that I can actually run 02-debloat in advance of
bringing the device up (00-netstate)... which I hope will fix it.

so with the debloating script running before netstate, AND a sleep 1
between the events, I\
get an oops again...

ge00: tx timeout
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-07-26T10:32:12" author="Dave Täht" >}}
So I can consistently lock it up by running ethtool -G ge00 tx 4 while
there is traffic...

but changing txqueuelen seems to work.

I note that I rename devices in part because I can never remember which
is the lan/wan ports and in part to make firewall rules easier. ge00 is
the wan port. Which also has the patch to give it a unique mac...

Moving on to attempting this change much earlier in the boot.

I feel compelled to point out that driver buffering should probably come
up automatically different when the link state is detected to be gigE,
100 or 10Mbit, but notice when it has been changed via ethtool...

all Linux network drivers should do that, actually. The problems we are
having with the ar71xx... is just the first, in a long road, towards
getting there.

I ran into similar problems attempting to debloat the common laptop
'e1000' driver, where it worked at 100Mbit, but failed to do TSO offload
properly at gigE speeds, with buffers below 64.
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-07-26T10:41:09" author="Dave Täht" >}}
success, I think.

I moved resetting ethtool to VERY early in the boot sequence in the
S10boot script... and got a working boot. Need to do some load
testing...

The ring buffer is completely independent of the transmit queue in Linux
today.

This is a major bug in Linux (and other OS's design), and we'll be
discussing this at LPC, I hope.

And yes, the default txqueuelen the driver should return should depend
on the link speed; this is a "safe" change. Cutting to 100 packets at
100Mbps, and (maybe) 10 at 10Mbps should have the same effect as we have
now without any chance of introducing problems. It's certainly the short
term "hack" until we have more intelligent buffer management across the
rings an transmit queue (and queue disciplines).

{{< issue_journal date="2011-07-27T15:35:14" author="Dave Täht" >}}
I have proven to my satisfaction that 4 driver buffers + 8 txqueuelen
buffers are enough to have sustained 100Mbit performance on this
hardware at 100Mbit. We can even go lower...

I do not have this fixed 'right'. Even with all the patches that flew by
on it, the only way that I can successfully\
change the ethernet tx ring is in /etc/init.d/boot before it comes up at
all.

Which is what I'm doing in cerowrt 1.0.
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2012-04-20T00:15:31" author="Dave Täht" >}}
I have been able to dynamically change the tx rings for a while...

but bql eliminates the need, and the default is now 64 anyway.
