{{< issue_description >}}
5ghz is much cleaner spectrum than 2.4ghz, so defaulting to ht40+ makes
sense.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-09-25T05:15:49" author="Dave Täht" >}}
This will be fixed in the first rc7 smoketest
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-09-30T14:19:44" author="Stephen Walker" >}}
Broken on the latest rc7 smoketest:\
`root`OpenWrt:\~\# wifi up\
\[...\]\
Configuration file: /var/run/hostapd-phy1.conf\
HT40 channel pair (40, 1) not allowed\
Interface initialization failed\
\[...\]@

Cerofiles' mac80211.sh needs to use channel 36 or 44 when using HT40+
per the freq table at
http://hostap.epitest.fi/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=hostap.git;a=blob;f=hostapd/hostapd.conf;hb=HEAD#l381.

OpenWrt's mac80211.sh is currently using channel 36.

I will use 36 in rc7-smoketest4 (this is still broken in smoketest3).
Thx for the heads up. I would prefer frankly to not use 36 or 44, but
something higher, as to not conflict with other APs by default.

The much higher 149 or 157 are available.

http://huchra.bufferbloat.net/~cero1/rc7-smoketests/rc7-smoketest4/

has HT40+ enabled on channel 36. It's also from openwrt head.

Seems to work well as a default
