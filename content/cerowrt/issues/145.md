{{< issue_description >}}
IPv6 Router Solicitation and announce messages are supplied via a fixed
timeout in the kernel.

Clients that have a wireless interface are "up" but may not have
"attached" to the wireless network.

The kernel will send 3 (by default) messages to an interface that is
"up" before giving up, long before it usually attaches to a wireless
network.

Hopefully this can be triggered on the server and client sides by a
script poking a /proc parameter.

some of this problem is merely due to these mice-like messages getting
stomped on by other traffic.

however, I think triggering a ra announce on a dhcp request is still a
good idea.
