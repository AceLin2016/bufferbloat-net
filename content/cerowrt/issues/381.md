{{< issue_description >}}
I am not getting radvd announcements after a long time in operation.

restarting radvd without the default firewall rules worked.

Not in a position to restore those rules, lets let radvd run for a few
days more,\
and I'll try to test that on another box.

I was figuring we'd broke radvd with the new kernel but apparently not.
