{{< issue_description >}}
I've now had three private reports of "speed" problems with the latest\
cerowrt releases.

All of them take serious uptime to occur. And unfortunately all the\
bug report(s) were, "oh, it\
got slow after everybody got home/ran a couple days, so I went back to\
the prior router".

That's not helpful, and could well be new users blaming the change\
rather than something else, but it is possible that this is happening,\
so... IF that happens to anyone here, I'd like\
to request a couple things in roughly this order

tcpdump -i ge00 -s 128 -w /tmp/myproblem.cap \# for 10 seconds hit\
cntrl-c Send me the file\
pinging the box from the outside world \# got packet loss?\
dmesg &gt; /tmp/dmesg.log \# send me the file\
logread &gt; /tmp/logread.log \# send me te file\
run top and see if there is a daemon running away\
tell me what ISP's network you are on...

restart the aqm system and see if it goes away\
/etc/init.d/aqm restart

try nfq\_codel and/or pie instead of fq\_codel

1\) I am aware of an old bug with odhcp6 where it would start hammering\
the network with\
requests for an ipv6 address in a tight loop. I don't know what\
triggers it. (with AQM set right it is hardly noticeable but\
"feelable". However if your bandwidth setting is even mildly wrong,\
boom life gets bad and STAYS bad)

If you look at the packet capture it will be filled with dhcpv6\
requests if this is what is happening.

Right now, I have a box dropping nearly every other packet for some\
reason. It's not in a place I can easily get at until tomorrow. It's\
been up for 90+ days and only started doing this recently

--- X.Y.Z.Q ping statistics ---\
60 packets transmitted, 42 packets received, 30.0% packet loss\
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 37.788/44.205/76.607/6.609 ms

It's my hope it's the above problem and is occurring now that comcast\
is rolling out ipv6

Off the top of my head I don't remember what you need to disable to\
turn it off. Certainly comment out the ge01 entry to turn it off.

2\) Random number generation has changed.

rngd is still enabled, so we're not running out of random numbers, but\
we could have other problems... check entropy?

3\) There could be a daemon running away (run top)

4\) Could have a new instruction trap problem under certain conditions

take a look at the /sys

dmesg\
logead

Hi Mike,

Looks like the cable modem router bug's been exercised again,\
dropping 30% of pings, and of course noticable in use:

Destination IP: 50.131.246.224\
Prior hop IP: 68.86.142.254\
Number of pings: 60\
PING 50.131.246.224 (50.131.246.224): 56 data bytes\
PING 68.86.142.254 (68.86.142.254): 56 data bytes

--- 68.86.142.254 ping statistics ---\
60 packets transmitted, 60 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 26.985/34.099/58.088/7.826 ms

It was, indeed, odhcpv6 running away, and totally saturating the
network.

I AM puzzled as to why it was noticable at all vs fq\_codel, my thought
is I should have captured more data than I just did....

I was experiencing 13% packet loss. running at nearly 100% of cpu,
too...

the router was runnign 3.7.1, so it predates the official 3.7 release of
cerowrt. I have no doubt this bug persisted in later versions and may
well persist today.

Also, we had major traps. I am vague on when we fully fixed these, but
I'm pretty sure it wasn't before 3.7.2

root@gw-comcast:/sys/kernel/debug/mips\# cat unaligned\_instructions\
17755733\
root@gw-comcast:/sys/kernel/debug/mips\# cat unaligned\_instructions\
17756005\
root@gw-comcast:/sys/kernel/debug/mips\#

Anyway, after killing off odhcpv6c entirely the system returned to
normal
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2013-11-22T19:58:13" author="Dave Täht" >}}
This box had been up for 56 days, and started exhibiting signs of
trouble at least a week ago.

odhcp6c is completely normal on the reboot, blocking in recv... (no ipv6
on this network)

Theory: the packet capture I just took shows "elapsed time" of 655350 ms
in the\
dhcpv6 field. Perhaps we've hit an overflow here, after X time
runnning....
