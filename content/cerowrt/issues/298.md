It's too hard to figure out what file you installed on a running router,
so bug reports are tough to correlate with builds. This causes confusion
and headaches in support. Would be nice to get the file name generated
when the build is created onto the status page somehow.

I suggest to embed an /etc/openwrt\_release with
DISTRIB\_DESCRIPTION="whatever should appear on the status page"
