There is some sort of discovery protocol that JetDirect uses (or at
least the Linux printing system uses to discover printers on the net).

This does not seem to be working; whether it can/should work in a routed
world is less clear.

I don't see this as highly important right now, but maybe someday...

Seems likely this is some sort of SNMP broadcast protocol being used to
discover the printers on the network, according to CUPS documentation.

Just to verify, the jetdirect protocol itself, works across the
networks, it's just discovery that is borked?

I note that guests should NOT be able to access printer resources on the
secure lan.

As for addressing this:

samba can run on the router, providing a central rendezvous point for
printer information.\
mdns - if implemented, and I thought it was in cups LONG ago, should
also be able to do the trick,\
but this would be a good test.

It's the discovery of the printer (via snmp broadcast) that seems to be
the problem here, if I read my tea leaves right. The cups configuration
stuff on Linux (and maybe mac) seems to use it to find printers when
configuring a new printer.

To confirm this theorya, we need to do a little bit of wire sniffing.

This begs the question of how common this use of snmp broadcast is in
other applications and operating systems.

I need to sniff to see what is happening when on the same segment so we
can figure out what the next step should be. See if SNMP theory of jg is
correct....
