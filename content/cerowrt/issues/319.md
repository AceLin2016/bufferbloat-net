The overhead of formatting a patch properly is trivial.

Getting a patch set into thunderbird or the web so totally dwarfs the\
tedium of actually creating the patch, it's unbelievable.

I have a string of mostly trivial patches I could have got out ages\
ago with git send-email. I could slam out patches every day that way\
and be a zillion times more effective coding-wise.

All year I have tried to get to where I could send email effectively\
from the command line on my laptop or wherever, and today's email\
server setups have become so complex that I have completely failed to\
find a way to so. (I note that I am frequently offline and need to be\
able to do it from my main development box, my laptop, and I have been\
highly mobile of late)

I recently spent most of a day trying to get bufferbloat.net's email\
server to take email from me, using sasl, or certs, and failed\
entirely.

I've been running my own email servers for 3 decades now, It's both\
embarrassing to me and unbelievable how difficult it's become to use\
such a basic transport.

And I USED to read my email with emacs. I liked it. I was FAR more\
productive switching from code to irc to email to patches and back\
when I didn't have to run tools like a browser and thunderbird all the\
time.

I have evolved to a system where I do a patch on the laptop, copy it up
to huchra, review it, make sure it applies, then send it. This is still
overly tedious but a heck of a lot better than what I was doing before.

I'd still prefer to do it all on the laptop
