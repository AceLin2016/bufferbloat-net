It is possible to limit the size of bind to below 24MB. Less than 32MB
would probably allow for decent caching.

I am under the impression there is a way to limit the jnl size to
something sane, and save more memory with acache? Bind is currently
staying sane and under 22MB of ram, which leaves room for strongswan
(48%) of ram, and the rest of the core utils, without endangering swap.

The max-journal-size option in named.conf limits the journal file size.
When the journal gets above the specified size, it will dump the current
zone data to the zonefile, create a new copy of the journal file with
the oldest records omitted, and replace the old copy with the new one.

You could also have a daily cron job that runs "rndc freeze" and "rndc
thaw"--that will cause the current version of the zone data to be dumped
to the zone file, and the journal file to be deleted entirely. (This is
problematic if you want to use IXFR, as the journal file is used to
reconstruct older versions of the zone data.)

We now limit the journal size to 100k per zone.

As for a daily cron job, the syntax is changing with 9.9 and this can be
safely deferred until the next release.

cron job needed? syntax stable?
