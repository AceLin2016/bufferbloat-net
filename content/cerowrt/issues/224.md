It looks like dnssec can be made much more manageable with a port of the
dnssec-tools,\
available here:

There's a bunch of stuff in dnssec-tools (some of which, AIUI,
duplicates functionality already available in BIND 9).

The only bit I was interested in was libval, which has DNSSEC-validating
versions of the get\*by\*() and get\*info() functions.

what I want is the NON dnssec validating versions of those functions!
Not in there?

No, what you want is the validating version.

The standard getaddrinfo() simply asks the resolver for an address. The
resolver attempts to validate the data, fails, and returns SERVFAIL; you
get nothing.

The validating version (I believe it's called val\_getaddrinfo()) takes
responsibility for validation by itself. It asks the resolver to provide
the address data and associated DNSSEC data, warts and all, without
validating it. (In other words it sets the CD bit on the query.) Then it
does its own validation. What you get is the data requested, plus
information about its validity, so you can decide for yourself whether
to use the information or not.

Honestly, what you **really** want is a simple flag to getaddrinfo() to
set the CD bit. But val\_getaddrinfo() is one way to get there without
having to muck with glibc or whatever library getaddrinfo() lives in.

Well, getting this right is on my list for RC6 or RC7. But I'm buried at
a conference all week.
