I'm moving this over to the bug report system so we can discuss it\
better there until we find resolution.

Hmm... No, there should be no difference, aside from the wireless\
cards and drivers installed.

And there is (at present) no physical difference between the 'G' and\
'N' networks, aside from the 2.4ghz radios being on the 64-96 range\
and the 5.x ghz being on the 97-126 range.

I have - because I give up on trying to make g and n co-exist properly\
- been considering actually putting them - at least for 5ghz - on\
separate networks. The AQM strategies then become MUCH easier.

but this is totally unrelated to your ongoing difficulties.

I really do admire your persistence in this.

Can I get you to take a huge step back? I kind of\
need to review everything you've tried and get a mental\
picture and frankly the best thing for me to do would be\
to somehow obtain an XP and vista box.

REBOOT EVERYTHING (std windows technique)

I've kind of lost track - do you have the ability to have\
two identical (eg windows 7 or windows xp)\
on either side of the network?

I'd like to eliminate the differences in OS version\
from the equation.

plug in TWO windows 7 boxes - only - into\
both sides. What happens then?

What do they do?

samba is providing wins service and SHOULD also be\
being elected a master browser at this point.

A way to tell if that is the case, is to, on the router

logread -F &

/etc/init.d/samba restart

and you should see a message go by saying that.

Note that browsing (seeing the workgroup, being able to list other
machines)\
is separate from name resolution (hostname -&gt; IP address). WINS only
gives\
you the latter.

Windows browsing information can generally not cross subnets unless you
are\
on a domain, you have a special browse master machine on each subnet\
(configured to sync to each other), or you do special magic to the
broadcast\
packets.

According to the Samba documentation, the way to get this working would
be to make the Samba server a Domain Master Browser
(http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/NetworkBrowsing.html#DMB).
The required changes to smb.conf are:

    [global]
    domain master = yes
    local master = yes
    preferred master = yes
    os level = 65

This would only work in the case where a domain server does not already
exist on the network.

I have committed a version of samba 3.6.1 to the ceropackages
repository.

Aside from verifying that it does, indeed build, I am not presently in a
position\
to test it - or even build it - in any way, as the main cerowrt tree is
temporarily\
too unstable for even me to use. If you have the ability to build
cerowrt-rc7 - and would\
like to play with this highly experimental - but hopefully thoroughly
compatable!\
package, you can do a

cd your ceropackages repo\
git pull\
cd your cerowrt repo\

./scripts/feeds install samba3x-server\
make menuconfig\
select the network section, below that will be options to build samba3x.

When your custom build is done, you can install it via opkg

Having tried setting my Linux machine up as a PDC earlier today, I have
the unfortunate news that I could not achieve cross-subnet browsing. The
news gets worse though. According to
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/117633, simply having a domain
controller is not enough, as reading the Samba documentation seemed to
suggest. You need to have the machines actually joined to the domain
too. This is a real problem for home users using CeroWRT, not least
because the home editions of Windows cannot join domains.

So, Steinar is entirely correct in saying that packet replication and/or
magic is needed to achieve this (or a proper domain, which is not an
option). Using "remote browser sync = <cerowrt router interfaces>" may
work for this, but may also successfully tie Samba up in knots talking
to itself.

The link I read said wins was the answer.

"You cannot browse domains on other subnets where the browse masters are
not listed in the LMHOSTS file. As an alternative to this, you can use
the Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS)."
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-12-07T17:26:57" author="Robert Bradley" >}}
I was working from:

"Windows NT or WFW workgroups cannot span multiple subnets. Workgroups
can view only other workgroups on the local subnet."

and assumed the text you quoted meant that the full domain setup was
needed. Looking at it again tonight, I managed to get this partially
working at home. Unlike earlier, I used the Samba server as both PDC and
WINS server. The setup was:

Subnet 1 (192.168.1.0/25): Windows 7 Ultimate (192.168.1.3)+Samba server
(192.168.1.2, routing between networks)\
Subnet 2 (192.168.1.128/25): Windows XP Home (192.168.1.131)+Samba
server (192.168.1.129)

This works.
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-12-08T07:15:57" author="Robert Bradley" >}}
Two things to note from last night's experimentation:

1.

Make sure SMB traffic from the remote subnet is not firewalled off!

2.

If the WINS server is not set up correctly, but the Samba server is
browse master on all the subnets, you can still get all the machines to
show up with "net view". However, actually resolving those names will
fail. For example, "net view \\\\computer" in Windows will fail with
error 53 (path not found). Using the IP address works fine.

My working /etc/samba/smb.conf file had the following:

    [global]
    # "domain logons" overkill?
    domain logons = yes
    domain master = yes
    local master = yes
    preferred master = yes
    os level = 255
    wins support = yes

That last line is essential for enabling the WINS server. On
OpenWRT/CeroWRT, this block must be added to the file
"/etc/samba/smb.conf.template".

our anti-phishing system kicked back on the numeric urls in this, fixed
now.

The reason why cerowrt lives on the 172 dot 30 dot 42 dot X address is
that\
it had been my hope that others working on this project would plug
**two**\
routers into their home network - one for the day-to-day effort of
keeping\
their internet access up and running (on 192 dot 168 dot zero dot one),
and\
a cerowrt box for analyzing both routers behavior.

**I** don't run it as my day-to-day device at the moment. From where I
sit,\
it's a test tool - an increasingly good one - for coming up with
solutions\
to bufferbloat, and fixing the whole home router disaster with things
like\
ipv6, proxying, dns, etc... it has oprofile, and debugging tools by\
default, etc, etc.

I had planned to get to where we had stable releases that could be used\
day-to-day, but it's been a while since we had one, and I feel that
we're\
going to make some progress on the core bufferbloat problem next
quarter,\
and not have a stable release.

I'm GLAD to have users and testers - some generations of cerowrt are\
running for people like jg, esr, & each, and have enormous stability
and\
uptimes - I don't know who else is running a generation of cerowrt\
day-to-day frankly, there's been a lot of downloads - but there will
always\
be something broken in a smoketest or rc, that may not be able to be
fixed\
very quickly. Or something crazy we're doing - like routing vs bridging
-\
that exposes a problem that we needed to know about....

Recently, that happened with samba. And while I hope that's fixed now
(in a\
couple ways - wins appears to be working, and I also have a largely\
untested samba 3.6.1 package, it needs to get tested at some point in
next\
year's development cycle)

http://www.bufferbloat.net/issues/314
http://www.bufferbloat.net/issues/303

I'd really like to use samba again personally, I used to use it a lot.\
These days I tend to use sshfs, and that's zillions of times slower
than\
samba.

Having a user support community and people testing release candidates
and\
smoketests is very important to me, too! I LOVED finding out how to
make\
samba work right...

So, high on my list is coming up with a proper way of stressing what's
on\
the front page of the documentation, and setting (low!) expectations,
and\
keeping people engaged...

From: http://cero2.bufferbloat.net/cerowrt/

"CeroWrt &lt;http://cero2.bufferbloat.net/cerowrt/about.html&gt; is an\
OpenWrt<http://www.openwrt.org/>router platform for use by\
individuals, researchers, and students\
interested in advancing the state of the art on the Internet.
Specifically,\
it is aimed at investigating the problems of latency under load,\
bufferbloat,
wireless-n&lt;http://cero2.bufferbloat.net/cerowrt/tcp.html\#wireless&gt;,
QoS &lt;http://cero2.bufferbloat.net/cerowrt/tcp.html#qos&gt;, and the
effects of\
various TCP algorithms\
&lt;http://cero2.bufferbloat.net/cerowrt/tcp.html#tcp&gt;on shared\
networks."

If there is some place in the doc where we are not putting up large
warning\
signs - 'BUGS AHEAD. DANGEROUS CODE. DON'T EXPERIMENT WITH THIS ON WIVES
OR\
CHILDREN' - I'd to find it and fix it.

I'm perfectly happy with the hardware and core software itself at this\
point. I wasn't, this time last year.

I'd like everybody in the open source and network research communities
to\
get TWO routers based on this chipset for christmas! Use one day to
day,\
running openwrt, and the other experimenting with a future outlined by
the\
ideas in cerowrt.

1\) I'd like to come up with a good way for people to plug this in as a\
'secondary' router.

Right now that requires turning off nat, and telling the upstream router
to\
give the cerowrt router a static ip and route to the 172 dot 30 dot 42
dot\
0 slash 24 address. Perhaps we can take some screenshots of how to do
that\
on more common CPE?

Network renumbering involves running a couple line sed script.

http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/Default\_network_numbering

I hope to make renumbering a router easier with a gui, but you know,
it's a\
3 line sed script and a couple hundred lines of gui to write to make
that\
easier.\
I'm also thinking of merely writing an RFC standardizing that 192 dot
168\
dot zero dot 1 should be the number ALL routers come up on, and the
number\
all home networks should use. For april 1st.

Bridging is also possible... but not very.

2\) Another thought is to do builds of the ceropackages repository for\
straight openwrt, and point people at that for things like the bleeding\
edge samba stuff.

I like ceropackages, it's a good way to spin up and debug a new
package,\
with a low barrier to entry for new people to openwrt - after which it
has\
always been my intent to push the stable stuff upstream. Multiple grad\
students have used the ceropackages concept to get up to speed somewhat
and\
steve walker's been great about polishing those up. (and also
submitting\
packages of his own)

3\) Is to more aggressively push up the stuff that works into std
openwrt.\
This is currently blocked by something stupid

http://www.bufferbloat.net/issues/319

or convince someone to push the stable stuff up to openwrt on a regular\
basis.

5\) Increase the number of people doing active development and able to
fix\
bugs and documentation.

Any other ideas as to accomplish these mutually incompatable goals -
gain\
developers, increase the userbase, gain testers,get good day to day and\
long term resolve, solve bufferbloat, establish world peace, and be able
to\
do bleeding edge R&D... are welcomed.

I do not ever want to disappoint people with our efforts, and will work\
diligently at fixing every problem exposed by the new stuff we're
doing.\
One of my first thoughts was pretty simple in this area though - try to
do\
less new stuff!

I should probably point people at that build as a 'stable' release, with
two\
known bugs (notably having to manually create the radios). We were\
very close with that smoketest!

(but shortly afterwards the build, the kernel, the driver, bind, ntp,
and ahcp\
all broke simultaneously, as did I. There was a ton of churn upstream,\
that is only now settling down)

So in the future, I need to come up with a good point to do a code
freeze\
in the release cycle. This is of course, in conflict with the idea of
closely\
tracking the kernel and openwrt development process,

Excellent! Thank you.

Preliminary testing indicated that andrews/felix's fixes for bugs 216
and 195\
got us to where openwrt was outperforming the factory firmware in most\
respects...

... but I immediately turned around and started sacrificing that raw
transfer\
performance for lower latency. (reduced tx rings, txqueues)

I'd like to think that that, also, improved performance by a few
metrics, but\
I don't plan on resuming serious testing on various benchmarks until\
after this coming development cycle is well underway.

In that effort thus far I've enabled a ton of debugging code to be able\
to look more closely at the effects on cpu of various AQM technologies,\
and what I have working at the moment just barely boots.

The core difference here at this point between cerowrt and openwrt is
the vastly\
reduced tx rings and txqueues - you can add these into openwrt easily by
editing\
/etc/init.d/boot to run ethtool at the right time, and adding\
/etc/hotplug.d/iface/00-debloat to openwrt.

I note I plan serious improvements to the basic debloat script there\
adding some intelligence to it - in the upcoming development cycle.

Another core difference is that on cerowrt's wireless, I did much more\
extensive\
diffserv classification than what's currently in the kernel mainline\
and openwrt.

In particular, one thing you can really 'feel' is that stuff with the\
IMM bit set\
(notably ssh), gets dumped into the VI queue, and that helps ssh a LOT.

Unfortunately that series of patches was terribly hacky and I still
haven't\
found a good way to rework them for submittal upstream.

You easily get the same behavior for things like ssh via iptables.

I got this working with CeroWRT 3.3.8-17 using the following
smb.conf.template:

    [global]
        netbios name = |NAME| 
        display charset = |CHARSET|
    #   interfaces = |INTERFACES|
    # Inelegant hack to get Samba listening on secure nets...
        interfaces = 127.0.0.1/8 lo se00 sw00 sw10
        server string = |DESCRIPTION|
        unix charset = |CHARSET|
        workgroup = |WORKGROUP|
        browseable = yes
        deadtime = 30
    # Domain logons=yes necessary for PDC
        domain logons = yes
        domain master = yes
        encrypt passwords = true
        enable core files = no
        guest account = nobody
        guest ok = yes
        invalid users = root
        local master = yes
        load printers = no
        map to guest = Bad User
        max protocol = SMB2
        min receivefile size = 16384
        null passwords = yes
        obey pam restrictions = yes
        os level = 20
        passdb backend = smbpasswd
        preferred master = yes
        printable = no
        security = user
        smb encrypt = disabled
        smb passwd file = /etc/samba/smbpasswd
        socket options = TCP_NODELAY IPTOS_LOWDELAY
        syslog = 2
        use sendfile = yes
        writeable = yes
        wins support = yes

The main issues were with |INTERFACES| only returning loopback and the
need for "domain logons = yes". I also added explicit firewall rules
allowing CIFS traffic from the secure interfaces (se00, sw10 and sw00).
