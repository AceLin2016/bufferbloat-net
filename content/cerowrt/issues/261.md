Along with whatever domain the router is serving...

In any case, after the installation, the router isn't serving
thegettys.net in its dns search path.

I'm not 100% sure about this though.

is that the sed script changes from home.lan to yourdomain.whatever. I
note that home.lan is entirely a fiction - there is no rfc1918 for
private domain systems, although the .lan is a fairly common convention.

That said, I personally find it confusing to have three entirely
separate namespaces AND databases for dns (.local, .lan, and whatever
you use as your main domain), and would prefer NOT to continue using
.lan after converting to a real domain such as thegettys.net.

.lan cannot be published to the main dns, among other problems.

Similarly, the proper usage of the subdomain system and views basically
makes the idea of gw.hm.thegettys.net sanest - where thegettys.net is a
dns server and web server located in the cloud, and hm.thegettys.net is
the one located on the gateway. This eliminates hits to the main dns
server(s) and simplifies view management.

I am mostly concerned that we have a single name to find the
administration of the network in the docs; I don't care if it is another
domain for any other services, or any other hosts appear in said domain.

the search path supplied in the good old days would let you say:
http://gw

and have that work

these days multiple browsers try to substitute solutions to the above.

We should create or adopt an internet standard for private dns.

Secondly, whatever we go with should be constant, not exposed to the
outside world, and not possible to override with other configuration
changes. Or so sayeth Jim.
