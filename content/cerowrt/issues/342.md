{{< issue_description >}}
allow-recursion is required if you have (for example) two cerowrt
routers and want one bind instance to provide name service to them both.

view "internal" {\
match-clients { "internal-net"; };\
recursion yes;\
allow-recursion { any; };

The default in cerowrt appears to be correct in this case.

It was just wrong on the dns server I was trying to interop with.
