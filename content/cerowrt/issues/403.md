Since the interface naming convention in CeroWrt defines the interfaces
based on their class e.g. 'ge00' instead of 'wan', the default NAT
reflection helper script fails to function. There is a simple fix
(thanks to jow who helped me discover this on \#bufferbloat)

edit the nat-reflection script:

    vi /etc/hotplug.d/firewall/10-nat-reflection

replace the first two occurences of "wan" with "ge00"\
save & exit, then issue:

    ifup ge00

I tested this on my wndr3800 running 3.3.8-11 and it worked. Didn't do
extensive testing but I tested several DNAT port-forwards from both
inside & outside of the NAT to services hosted on the se00 (lan) side
and everything seemed to work as expected.
