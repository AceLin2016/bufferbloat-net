{{< issue_description >}}
dibbler-client sort of worked for me when I had a server feeding it,
but\
after running overnight, it started consuming 100% of cpu when it\
was not getting an address from anywhere.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2012-03-01T08:21:14" author="Dave T채ht" >}}
I ran it overnight again with the same cpu issue, and further, when
attempting to reboot, the process was so wedged as to prevent a reboot
without manually killing off dibbler-client.

wide-dhcp-pd is usable. Can't spend time on this now.
