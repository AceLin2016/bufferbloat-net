{{< issue_description >}}
Several domains that I use regularly will not resolve when proxied by my
CeroWRT 3.10.48-2 router, and nor will they resolve from the CeroWRT
network diagnostics page. When setting the resolv.conf of a host behind
my router manually to point to a known good resolver, however, they
resolve correctly.

I have not been able to determine what causes this.

The symptoms from the client are that queries are sent to the CeroWRT
device but it never returns a response. Compare this failing lookup:

16:51:36.140676 IP 192.168.33.1.43897 &gt; 192.168.33.254.53: 27175+ A?
debian.org. (28)\
16:51:41.140752 IP 192.168.33.1.43897 &gt; 192.168.33.254.53: 27175+ A?
debian.org. (28)\
\[no response\]

With this successful lookup:

16:51:51.220838 IP 192.168.33.1.57704 &gt; 192.168.33.254.53: 55242+ A?
psg.com. (25)\
16:51:51.221277 IP 192.168.33.254.53 &gt; 192.168.33.1.57704: 55242
1/0/0 A 147.28.0.62 (41)

Examples of domains that fail reliably are debian.org (as above) and
lkml.org. I have not identified any specific feature of these domains'
records that may cause this, but I haven't examined them closely.

I suspect, but do not know, that the problem is domains that declare an
IPv6 nameserver. This seems to have a high correlation with problematic
domains.

dnssec in this version of cerowrt should be disabled. Too many edge
cases found.

No update planned to 2.73, which solved most of them.

Great! How do I disable dnssec?
