In smoketest 4 of RC6, the WAN port would not DHCP on my local network;
which is a bit of a mess.

It was plugged into a DLINK DGS-2208 Gigabit switch, which is plugged
into a 100Mbit switch, which is plugged into a WNDR3700v2 (running the
Bismark build).

Hypothesis: it might have problems if it sees ethernet pause frames. I
first became aware of pause frames when I saw them in a wireshark
capture I took off this switch last fall.

My laptops dhcp off this switch just fine, FWIW.

This problem appears to be present still in real RC6. Plugged directly
into the router serving as my home router, it dhcp's on the wan port
fine and works.

We need to find a way to reproduce this in front of a developer that has
this switch AND problem.

I was unable to reproduce in a similar environment.

OK, I'll get a new switch ordered so that I can take the existing one
that seems to trigger it out of service (mercifully), and we can
reproduce it in front of someone able to debug it.

Weirder and weirder. I thought that the switch in question was a 100Mbit
switch; instead, it's a netgear 108p (8 port 10/100/1000Mbit POE
switch). Additionally, I have another level of switching beyond this (a
d-Link 2208). So I need to do a bit more debugging, and plug the router
one step back (directly into the netgear) first to confirm at what level
the problem is.

I'll argue it's at the number of levels it's at... rule of thumb: never
connect more than 3 switches together.

Yeah, but the factory firmware coped ok, when I tried it before.

I'll do a more systematic round of tests in the morning.

so far as I know this hasn't been a problem in months.
