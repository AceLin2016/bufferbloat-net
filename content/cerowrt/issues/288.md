{{< issue_description >}}
In a recent experiment with cerowrt, some duplicate pings were seen,
largely when the network was otherwise idle.

I am really hard pressed to think of circumstances where seeing
duplicate pings can happen, given the various forms of ARQ and block
acks built into 802.11n. The fact that it was happening on an idle (2
hop) network implies (to me) that single packet transfers may have an
issue in retries that multipacket transfers do not.

Things that tweak me on this topic were the recent sack related analysis
and dan's work on coverfire

http://www.coverfire.com/archives/2011/10/15/linux-flow-classifier-proto-dst-and-tos/

which pointed to oddball packets being mishandled elsewhere in the
stack. The experiment was otherwise successful, showing a distinct
improvement in latency when a txqueuelen of 37 was used vs a txqueuelen
of 1000, on the router, and for all I know there ARE circumstances in
802.11n where you will see duplicate packets... but interestingly, no
dups were seen in the txqueuelen 1000 test.

Further experiments are needed.

Hi,

> Obviously I need to learn enough R to be able to do this sort of
analysis myself. In the interim, since I'm doing a similar experiment
monday (this time varying either classification of ping or the queue-ing
algorithm, not the buffer size - I haven't decided which), we'd love to
see your script in the hope I can immediately use it in the class...

Ok. lets see. I created something that should ease up the plotting. See
attached tar archive and sample plot. To summarize there is a Makefile
which plots the data and expects:\
- p1.txt and p2.txt as input (which should be the logs from the ping
command)\
- awk and sed to be installed and in the path\
- GNU R to be installed and in the path

What it does is:\
1.) extracts the RTT timeseries 'hopefully' covering the download
period, by looking for the ping sequence number (SEQ) with maximum RTT
(MAX) and considering all RTTs from SEQ-100 to SEQ+100.\
2.) replacing all timeouted pings with an RTT value of MAX+100ms, where
the 100ms can be configured in the BEGIN clause of the awk script.\
3.) plot the two time series.

What it includes:\
- extract.timeseries.awk (performs steps 1+2)\
- plotit.R (performs step 3)\
- Makefile (wrapper)\
- p\*.txt example input files

> As for these plots, what I'd like:\
>\
> the Y axis to stay in the the same range of 0 - 1000 ms

(for the combined plot i determine the maximum RTT and use that as an
upper bound)

> the X axis to be 100 seconds long, showing the idle period, the
spike, the idle period.

(i opted for a 200 second = 200 ping samples period instead)

> the two plots to be directly comparable, using a different color
for the ping 'dots', and roughly the same start time, so I can overlay
them...

already done. Only one output plot.

> 1) start time is uncontrolled (but close enough, given the length
of transfer)

you can 'tune' the input data and have the input file start at a chosen
point in time that is less than 100 seconds before the maximum to
achieve this.\
(I did not want to get into more sophisticated methods for determining
the download period from the data, sofar)

> 4) tcpdump on at least several stations would be VERY interesting.
Dario says you were seeing some interesting duplicate acks - I still
haven't verified we've actually FIXED the stack enough to get reliable
results.

No what we saw is ping reporting "(DUP!)" behind some lines.

> Would you be interested in following up this line of work with a
paper w/me/etc?

sure.

I just wanted to express how (other than the dup ping issue) utterly\
happy I am with the attached txqueuelen37 vs 1000 plot.

txqueuelen 37 REALLY works vs 1000 - and the real sources of the\
bottlenecks have moved to the clients, not the AP. On to testing queue\
management!

Is 37 the right number? don't know. Is it a better number than 1000 -\
you betcha!

Andrew, are you still thinking 100 is better for google's iw10 mice
attack?

oh, I forgot to mention what REALLY tweaked me (athough it's not shared
by the remainder of the data set and is probably totallllly a matter of
mere misfortune) and made me jump at shadows like this one.

first dup is packet 67\
second dup is packet 104.

104-67 = 37, which is my txqueuelen.

Can't reproduce at current txqueuelen

Seemed fixed. TXquelen == 40 seems to have fixed it..... Bizarre.
