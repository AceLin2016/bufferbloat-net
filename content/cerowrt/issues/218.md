Richard Smith from olpc writes in with his experience in China:

For most of us it worked fine but we actually didn't use it much this
time. Quanta provided us with a AP instead. Its was some fancy Motorola
PoE job. The network was a wpa network which is a hassle for doing
firmware upgrade and software imaging via http.

We switched to the wndr briefly so we had an open network. Sadly you
just can't run an open network at anymore. Loads of squatters appear.
You can't bandwidth restrict them since the XO's are in the same
catagory. It work ok except for one of the other developers who
complained that his connection to 2.4Ghz keep dropping. Most of the rest
of us were on 5G and didn't see a problem. Due to that complaint we
switched back to the Motorola and just dealt with the wpa network.

I took the router back with me to the hotel at night and used it without
problems. I had to turn on encryption for 2.4G (again due to squatters)
but I used the 5G open.

I think I have a possible solution for the open network for the next
time. I think I can use nodogsplash with a site wide password so that
once a MAC has been authorized it will stay that way. I'm not sure how
I'll deal with firmware access (no browser). I'll have to craft up a
recipe for doing a post with the right values so XO's can auth from the
firmware.

Not sure about the 2.4 dropping complaint but given that there will be
many creowrt releases between now and then I'm not going to worry about
it.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-07-31T06:59:00" author="Dave Täht" >}}
I have heard multiple reports of 2.4 ghz weirdnesses over the last 4
months with no solid data on what kind of hardware it was happening on.
Could I convince some folk to install the lastest release candidate of
cerowrt, get connected at 2.4 ghz (using both crypto, and not!), and
stay online for a while - days, even - to see what happens? so we can
gain insight into the existence or non-existence of this problem?

A temporary home for cerowrt release candidates is at:

http://huchra.bufferbloat.net/~cero1/

I hope to get an rc5 out late this coming week.

And I hope we get the testlab back up again soon.

Matt, Jacopo, could you 'hang out' on your routers at 2.4ghz and for a
long time... and see if they drop the connect(s)? If not, let me know
your hardware. If so, let me know your hardware.

Some of this is speculation. I wish I had more precise details. This is\
true\
of all trunk versions in last few weeks, when I started using my G300H
(v2)\
as an AP. This includes upto version r28254, which includes yesterday's\
mac80211 patches, but not today's spam fixes.

I have two Linux machines connecting to it. After some amount of time -
or\
what seems more likely, data, the WiFi connections will drop. If left\
alone, they will come back after about 5 minutes. But it's usually\
faster to reboot the router.

I believe that:

-   LAN side is unaffected.
-   It happens after a certain about of traffic, rather than time, since
    it'll\
    be fine during the night when not much is happening, but be
    triggered during\
    a download etc during the day.
-   Attempts to reproduce by running large amounts of traffic with iperf
    from\
    WiFi -&gt; Wired LAN have been inconsistent.
-   In one case where I saw it triggered, I restarted hostapd, and it
    seemed\
    to\
    come back, although NetworkManager on Ubuntu become confused, so
    I'm\
    not certain.
-   There is nothing of consequence in kernel logs, apart from regular\
    messages\
    from hostapd about group key handshake.

So, I'm after ideas about more precise information I can gather, debug\
I can turn on, etc, etc.

Actually, please test 27957 instead.

Lacking further data, I'm closing this bug.
