Luci and /proc/cpuinfo reports WNDR3800 as an WNDR3700v2. This is
probably a won't fix bug.

I think it would be be mildly better to have it recognise this for a
3800 actually. I will compare the two devices however to make sure there
are no other sigificant differnces (switch, mac, etc)

If we want to we could fix this. I found a way to do it. Tested it and
works. With the patch everything looks like it should.

cat /proc/cpuinfo\
system type : Atheros AR7161 rev 2\
machine : NETGEAR WNDR3800\
processor : 0\
cpu model : MIPS 24Kc V7.4\
BogoMIPS : 452.19\
wait instruction : yes\
microsecond timers : yes\
tlb\_entries : 16\
extra interrupt vector : yes\
hardware watchpoint : yes, count: 4, address/irw mask: \[0x0000, 0x0ff8,
0x0ff8, 0x0ff8\]\
ASEs implemented : mips16\
shadow register sets : 1\
kscratch registers : 0\
core : 0\
VCED exceptions : not available\
VCEI exceptions : not available

But make sure that there are no significant difference with the
hardware. I don't have a wndr3700v2 to compare against.

Explicitly identifing a wndr3800 as a wndr3800 will need a
/etc/defconfig/ set of files created.

However, I'll give it a shot on smoketest8 and then we can run it past
jow... I am interested to see what more memory does to (for example) the
default tcp window calculation (which is FAR TOO SMALL) that I currently
override in /etc/sysctl.conf for the 3700v2.

My patch broke the sysupgrade. It tried to check for something that
didn't exist. I fixed my patch so sysupgrade works. Let's hope that
there isn't a lot of other quirks.
