{{< issue_description >}}
Now that ahcp can work, I started deploying a more complex mesh network,
and although routes and dns information (UDP) get through, tcp
connections do not.

I am thinking I have one of two problems. One is that the server needs
to be configured on fixed ips/thenetmask OR the default firewall rules
inside of openwrt are messing things up for the mesh interfaces... or
there is something else wrong deeper.

More news as it happens.

I have some thought towards bug \#266 being a source of this problem
