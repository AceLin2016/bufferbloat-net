In the only box I've managed to keep running this long, dhcp has stopped
serving new addresses.

root@labgw:\~\# uptime\
19:39:04 up 5 days, 15:20, load average: 0.16, 0.06, 0.05

restarting dnsmasq fixed it. There have been multiple builds since then,
of course, and I've beaten this machine up with many, many tests, and it
used to have bug \[\#136\] which I killed off by hand.

Strange. In the old build, I've got an uptime of around 20 days, and
DHCP is working fine.

Let's try a new build out in the house I'm staying in tomorrow.

I'd like to figure out how to daisy chain these switches, as well.

Assuming the <link>bismark-testbed:Testlab</link> remains operation, I
should able to slowly debug this.

Regrettably, there seems to be no way to simulate the problem, except
time and multiple routers deployed. IT MAY be related to issue \#147 and
\#145

As for "daisy chaining, or using the mesh" please open separate bugs for
those.

I have multiple reports of the dhcp problem now. I am hoping that the
switch patch fixes it,\
but to test it fully I will have to hammer a router for several days
from another router (or two or three) with dhcp queries.

Thankfully with the PDU coming online, if it hangs I can reset it.

I have several other related patches queued up, if that alone doesn't
address the issue.
