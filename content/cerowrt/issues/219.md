{{< issue_description >}}
I had planned to do this for a while now. Our dropbear is already
patched to be runnable out of xinetd, I have half a patch to make xinetd
oom-killer aware, and there's half a xinetd sensors package around that
locks out people (bots, actually) entirely that attempt telnet to the
router.

I feel uncomfortable skipping the oom-killer patch, but as fiddling with
dropbear and doing it wrong would be bad, getting dropbear to work out
of xinetd first, correctly, strikes me as the least risky, so I MAY
given time, move dropbear to xinetd and get the sensors package working\
before RC5.

## History

dropbear now runs out of inetd.

Also, sensors are configured on telnet and ftp attempts to the router.

Why are there bugs **I** can't CLOSE?

dropbear could use some improvement, yes, both on oom, and on max-cpu
behavior.

but the oom bug is separate.
