Notable Quotes
==============

"FQ\_Codel provides great isolation... if you've got low-rate
videoconferencing and low rate web traffic they never get dropped. A lot
of issues with IW10 go away, because all the other traffic sees is the
front of the queue. You don't know how big its window is, but you don't
care because you are not affected by it. FQ\_Codel increases utilization
across your entire networking fabric, especially for bidirectional
traffic. If we're sticking code into boxes to deploy codel, don't do
that. Deploy fq\_codel. It's just an across the board win.‚Äù - Van
Jacobson

    I finally installed it on my router and wow, does it ever help. I
    get a much more responsive internet connection when my roommate is
    watching Netflix. Hearing how much bufferbloat affects performance
    is one thing but actually seeing the difference is
    pretty amazing.](https://lists.bufferbloat.net/pipermail/cerowrt-devel/2015-June/004835.html) -
