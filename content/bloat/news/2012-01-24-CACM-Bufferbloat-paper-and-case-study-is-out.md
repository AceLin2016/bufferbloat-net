CACM Bufferbloat paper is out. It's the same as the ACM Queue version,
but killing trees... You too can read it in the comfort of your
bathroom.

The case study conversation led by Vint Cerf is in the February issue,
but that hasn't arrived in at least my mailbox yet.

FWIW: they should be fixing the access on the ACM digital library site
to be public, once I deal with copyright stuff. But the ACM queue links
are just fine for now.
