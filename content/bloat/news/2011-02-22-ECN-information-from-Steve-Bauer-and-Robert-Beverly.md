Steve Bauer has been kind enough to give me a copy of his slides,
slightly tweaked since that workshop, that goes over the state of ECN.
They are much better than half-baked, but they are very much a work in
progress. It has a quick overview of how ECN is implemented, and then
goes into the current state of deployment and problems uncovered.

[Pointers to the slides and a bit of discussion are in my
blog](http://gettys.wordpress.com/2011/02/22/caida-workshop-aims-2011-bauer-and-beverly-ecn-results/)
