If people have heard of bufferbloat at all, it is usually just an
abstraction despite having personal experience with it. Bufferbloat can
occur in your operating system, your home router, your broadband gear,
wireless, and almost anywhere in the Internet. They still think that if
they experience poor Internet speed means they must need more bandwidth,
and take vast speed variation for granted. Sometimes, adding bandwidth
can actually hurt rather than help. Most people have no idea what they
can do about bufferbloat.

So I’ve been working to put together several demos to help make
bufferbloat concrete, and demonstrate at least partial mitigation. The
mitigation shown may or may not work in your home router, and you need
to be able to set both upload and download bandwidth.

Two of four cases we commonly all suffer from at home are:

1.  Broadband bufferbloat (upstream)
2.  Home router bufferbloat (downstream)\
    Rather than attempt to show worst case bufferbloat which can easily
    induce complete failure, I decided to demonstrate these two cases of
    “typical” bufferbloat as shown by the ICSI data. As the bufferbloat
    varies widely as the ICSI data shows, your mileage will also
    vary widely.

There are two versions of the video:

1.  [A short bufferbloat
    video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npiG7EBzHOU), of slightly over
    8 minutes, which includes both demonstrations, but elides most of
    the explanation. It’s intent is to get people “hooked” so they will
    want to know more.
2.  [The longer version of the
    video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D-cJNtKwuw) clocks in at 21
    minutes, includes both demonstrations, but gives a simplified
    explanation of bufferbloat’s cause, to encourage people to dig
    yet further.
