I've put a fairly large (and yet still incomplete) summary of the voip
conference call with the freeswitch folk up at:

http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/bloat/wiki/Bufferbloat\_and\_Freeswitch\_Conference\_Call\_March\_9

The call went on for over 2 hours as we discussed all aspects of
bufferbloat as it applies to telephony. The call was recorded, and here
is a link to the recording:

If you have a listen, and hear something interesting that I did not
document, please update the wiki page!

Some interesting tidbits:

-   Some freeswitch users are using TCP Vegas for their servers due to
    the\
    latency sensitivity of that form of TCP and their need to
    prioritize\
    RTP traffic
-   getting time right on various virtual server technologies is doable,
    but hard
-   freeswitch handled 32+ people in the conference using a variety of\
    dial-in technologies really well.
-   Their wiki was very wrong on recomendations for voip
    servers (corrected)

I'm thinking that doing a weekly conference call among ourselves here
might be useful. Thoughts?

Again, way more detail on the call is at:
