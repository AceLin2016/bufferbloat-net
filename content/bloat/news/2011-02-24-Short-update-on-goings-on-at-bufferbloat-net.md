WHAT A MONTH!\
(and it isn't over yet)
=======================

Since John Carmack was just kind enough to tweet about us, I thought I'd
put up the latest news as fast as I could:

[What is bufferbloat,
anyway?](http://gettys.wordpress.com/what-is-bufferbloat-anyway/)

For indepth background on bufferbloat, see and hear these [slides and
brief audio](http://mirrors.bufferbloat.net/Talks/BellLabs01192011/)

Bufferbloat is a **major** problem in all the new kit coming out this
year - cable modems and 802.11n routers especially. Latencies get so
high as to make fragging frickin impossible.

There is some gamer specific discussion in the above link, as well as
elsewhere on [Jim Gettys' blog](http://gettys.wordpress.com/)

For the current status of our increasingly world wide efforts - see the
mailing list archives:

[general bufferbloat
discussion](https://lists.bufferbloat.net/pipermail/bloat/2011-February/thread.html)

[bufferbloat development
discussion](https://lists.bufferbloat.net/pipermail/bloat-devel/2011-February/thread.html)

Multiple new algorithms are being both discussed as well as tested. A
Linux kernel repository just went up at:

http://git.infradead.org/debloat-testing.git

there are now 131 people on the mailing list, and 19 people and one
robot regularly in the \#bufferbloat channel on irc.

While bufferbloat is not a Linux-specific problem, we're the first
community out the gate with solutions and patches. We are actively
looking for iphone, ipad, and android users to test some basic
assumptions regarding <link>ECN</link>. (if you are on an iphone, and
having trouble accessing this site or [this
mp3](http://mirrors.bufferbloat.net/Talks/BellLabs01192011/Bufferbloat_Talk_Edited_For_brevity.mp3)
, please let us know!)

Brian Proffitt just wrote a good intro to the [latency under load
problem](http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/netsp/article.php/39260760)

And there are tons of <link>Papers|research papers</link>, tools and
<link>Linux Tips</link> linked to off of our <link>wiki</link>.

the [mailing list](https://lists.bufferbloat.net/listinfo/bloat) and
site have been up for less than a month.

Please join us and help beat the bloat!
