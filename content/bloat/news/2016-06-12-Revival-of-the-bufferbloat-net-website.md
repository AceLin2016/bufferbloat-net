title: Revival of the Bufferbloat.net website
type: news
---

The Bufferbloat.net web site has been offline for a while, due to a
hardware failure of the machine hosting the old Redmine installation.
Rather than revive the aging installation, we have converted the site to
a static site using the Hugo site generator (see https://gohugo.io).

You are looking at the result of this conversion. There are still some
rough edges, but most of the old content is there. Please bear with us
while we work out the remaining kinks of the conversion.

The source files are hosted
[on Github](https://github.com/tohojo/bufferbloat-net) and pull requests
to add or improve the content are very welcome.
