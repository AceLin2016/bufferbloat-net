{{< issue_description >}}
Jim Gettys will be giving two talks at the upcoming [Battlemesh
conference](http://battlemesh.org/BattleMeshV4/Agenda) March 16-19, in\
Sant Bartomeu del Grau (SBG for short), near Barcelona, Catalunia,
Spain.

One will be a condensed version of the existing Bell Labs bufferbloat
talk, the other will be about OLPC meltdowns.

There are also interesting talks scheduled about babel-z, the mesh
potato, and other topics of interest to the mesh networking community.

Not to mention the battle of the mesh technologies! I have some hope
that the best debloated router will win!
