Mission
=======

![](/images/jigsawfish-small.png) The [dark buffers](Dark_buffers.md)
that lead to <link>bloat:Bufferbloat</link> and the congestion/latency
problems that currently plague the internet are *almost* everywhere. The
Bufferbloat project intends to address these problems by:

-   Gathering together experts to tackle the queue management and system
    problem(s), particularly those that effect wireless networks
-   Spreading the word to correct basic assumptions regarding
    [goodput](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodput) and good buffering
    on the laptop, home gateway, core routers and servers.
-   Producing tools to demonstrate and diagnose the problem
-   Experiments in advanced congestion management
-   Producing patches to popular operating systems at the device driver,
    queuing, and TCP/ip layers to fix the problems.

There are [several mailing lists](https://lists.bufferbloat.net), git
repositories, and people here that are attempting to address the
Bufferbloat issues at various levels.
