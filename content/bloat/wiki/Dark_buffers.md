Dark buffers
------------

Large network buffers can be thought of as 'dark buffers', analogous to
'dark matter' in the universe. They are undetectable under most
circumstances, and you can detect them only by indirect means. Buffers
do not cause problems when they are empty. But when they fill they
introduce additional latency (and create other problems, possibly very
severe) to other traffic sharing the link.

The [Buffer Bloat project](/projects/bloat) is dedicated to finding and
mitigating Dark Buffers.
