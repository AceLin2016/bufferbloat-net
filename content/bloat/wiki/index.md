Introduction to Bufferbloat
---------------------------

We've written an [Introduction]({{< relref "bloat/wiki/Introduction.md" >}}) to the bufferbloat problem
that we believe is both accessible to non-technical readers and
informative to techies. We recommend you start there to get a feel for
the nature and scope of the problem. Then, read our
[mission statement]({{< relref "bloat/wiki/Mission.md" >}}) to find out what we're doing
about it.

There's also a [Glossary]({{< relref "bloat/wiki/Glossary.md" >}}) that goes into more technical depth
on bufferbloat-related terminology. You may find an older
[technical introduction]({{< relref "bloat/wiki/TechnicalIntro.md" >}}) interesting if you
are a programmer or network engineer.

More reading
------------

Many of the [symptoms]({{< relref "bloat/wiki/CongestionSymptoms.md" >}}) of
bufferbloat-induced congestion have an immediate, user-visible impact on
performance. If you're not sure you are seeing these, there are
[experiments]({{< relref "bloat/wiki/Experiments.md" >}}) you can perform on your home
hardware to detect bufferbloat problems. If you want to jump straight to
fixing the problem, we have a
[Mitigation and Solutions]({{< relref "bloat/wiki/Mitigations_and_Solutions.md" >}}) page.

Much of the original analysis and discussion of bufferbloat took place
on technical blogs. We have collected a
[tasty selection of blog references]({{< relref "bloat/wiki/Good_blog_discussions.md" >}})
for your reading pleasure.

You can read bufferbloat-related [Quotes]({{< relref "bloat/wiki/Quotes.md" >}}) from the great,
near-great, and and not-so-great. A page of unashamedly geeky
[Humor]({{< relref "bloat/wiki/Humor.md" >}}) exists as well.

There is also a list of [Product]({{< relref "bloat/wiki/Product.md" >}}) specific pages.

Mailing lists and Participating
-------------------------------

Our project has very active [mailing
lists](https://lists.bufferbloat.net) on which we're developing
anti-bufferbloat fixes, diagnostic tools, documentation, and other fun
things. You can also look at a [ToDo]({{< relref "bloat/wiki/ToDo.md" >}}) list of projects that
need work.

Please [join the project](http://www.bufferbloat.net/account/register)
and pitch in.
