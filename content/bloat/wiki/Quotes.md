> “Bufferbloat is a huge problem. The only way we're going to fix this
> problem is to get the people making the devices that have these large
> scale buffers in them to artificially reduce their size. The problem
> is a feedback loop - it takes too long to discover that there is a
> problem because we allow everything to fill up the buffers. Because
> memory got cheap, people stuff buffers in because they thought it
> would help... and in fact at some point it doesn't. I hope that Gettys
> and others are able to persuade people that they really need to
> re-engineer systems to not have more memory than is absolutely
> necessary. \[elided\] How many bad things have happened and somebody
> said 'I was only trying to help?'.”\

> “Our biggest mistake was in making queue management optional, and
> making it **scary**.”

[Van Jacobson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jacobson)
---------------------------------------------------------

> “Something else that has impeded progress here—all that R&D aimed at
> maximizing the bandwidth between supercomputer centers. Remember that
> most of the network research in the U.S. has been funded so far by the
> NSF (National Science Foundation) with the goal of demonstrating very
> high bandwidth between academic institutions. This is great for the
> .01 percent of the Internet community that has those links available
> to them, but it doesn't do much good for the billion other people in
> the world who have 2-megabit or less. We've put a lot of effort into
> protocol, router, and algorithm development that makes it possible for
> a single TCP to saturate a 40-gigabit link, but we haven't put
> anything even remotely like that effort into producing usable
> cellphone data links, DSL links, or home-cable links. That's where the
> really hard problem is because it requires that you start to think
> about how the buffering actually works and how it turns into latency.”

> “Without this being resolved, Internet phones are dead in the long run
> as more people are jamming up the Internet with Roku, Hulu and Netflix
> – streaming video Internet no doubt exasperating the present problem.
> And gamers, who are willing to spend heavily to win, may give up if
> their Internet connection makes it impossible to win. ”

[Rob Landley](http://landley.livejournal.com/43985.html)
--------------------------------------------------------

> “The end result \[of bufferbloat\] is crazy bursts of throughput and
> multisecond latency spikes.”

[Kathleen Nichols](http://www.pollere.net/about.html)
-----------------------------------------------------

> “Most traffic control mechanisms do not work the way people think they
> work. Intuition fails us.”

[Eric Raymond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond)
------------------------------------------------------------

> “Wow. This is **not complicated**. How did we miss this for so long?"

[Dave Täht](http://www.taht.net)

> “After going off this cliff, we need to replace the wheels and engine,
> and strap on wings before we hit bottom.”

[Linus Torvalds](http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0904.0/02094.html)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> “Latency is more important than throughput. It's that simple.”

[Nick Weaver](http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~nweaver/)
-----------------------------------------------------

> “When testing for this particular problem, the **outliers** actually
> prove to be the good networks.”
