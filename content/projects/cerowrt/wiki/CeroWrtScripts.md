CeroWrtScripts Bundle
=====================

CeroWrtScripts is a set of scripts that you can use for maintaining and
troubleshooting a CeroWrt router. It is archived on
[Github.com](https://github.com/richb-hanover/CeroWrtScripts). The
bundle includes scripts to:

-   **Measure the performance** of your router - *betterspeedtest.sh,
    netperfrunner.sh, networkhammer.sh*
-   **Configure the CeroWrt router** consistently after flashing factory
    firmware - *config-cerowrt.sh*
-   **Set up an IPv6 6-in-4 tunnel** to TunnelBroker.net -
    *tunnelbroker.sh*
-   **Collect troubleshooting information** (see [Debugging CeroWrt]({{< relref "wiki/cerowrt/Debugging_CeroWrt.md" >}})) that helps us diagnose problems - *cerostats.sh*

How do I get these scripts?
---------------------------

1.  CeroWrt 3.10.44 and newer contain the scripts built into the router.
    They are in `/usr/lib/CeroWrtScripts`
2.  You can also get the [full suite of
    scripts](https://github.com/richb-hanover/CeroWrtScripts) from
    **Github** (https://github.com/richb-hanover/CeroWrtScripts)

The docs for the scripts are now maintained in Github.
