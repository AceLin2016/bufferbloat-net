Setting up AQM for CeroWrt 3.10
===============================

**THIS PAGE IS DEPRECATED** in favor of the
[Setting up SQM for CeroWrt 310]({{< relref "wiki/cerowrt/Setting_up_SQM_for_CeroWrt_310.md" >}}) page.

**Why?**

Smart Queue Management (SQM) is our name for an intelligent combination
of better packet scheduling (flow queueing) techniques along with with
active queue length management (AQM).

We've moved away from the term "Active Queue Management" (AQM) because
[Dave TÃ¤ht points
out](https://lists.bufferbloat.net/pipermail/cerowrt-devel/2013-December/001840.html)
that it has pretty much come to be defined as active queue **length**
management and not packet scheduling.

If you want to set up your CeroWrt router, see the <link>Setting up SQM
for CeroWrt 3.10</link> page.
