RFP process
===========

Network research is made especially hard by not having a good stable
hardware base to work from, with open source components sufficient to
make a difference.

We plan to generate one or more RFPs to find a hardware or chipset
manufacturer willing to design a board and chipset suitable to meet our
requirements for a low latency wifi solution.

We may also run a kickstarter in order to push hardware development
along.
