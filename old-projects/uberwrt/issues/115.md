Need a SFB kernel module package to test SFB with.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-07T12:13:24" author="Dave Täht" >}}
I had to backport two functions from 2.6.38 to make the SFB package
compile in 2.6.37.

But it now compiles and I'm off to test it in real life.

Pushed into the cerowrt repo.
