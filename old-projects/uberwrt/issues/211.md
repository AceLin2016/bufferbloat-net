{{< issue_description >}}
On safari and chrome the on-board web pages work, except that the css
shows the nav bar mildly wrong.

On firefox 3.6.17 and 3.6.18, however, it is making links look like
centered menus...

This is on linux. ubuntu 10.10. I will upload a screenshot if nobody
else has this version of firefox running on their platform.

Bad CSS on
https://github.com/dtaht/ceropackages/blob/master/utils/cerowrt-chrome/files/etc/uberwrt/static/cerowrtstyle.css#L67
&
https://github.com/dtaht/ceropackages/blob/master/utils/cerowrt-chrome/files/etc/uberwrt/static/cerowrtstyle.css#L78.

`div.menu a:link,
div.menu a:visited`

&

`div.menu a:hover,
div.menu a:active`

is what I believe were intended.

Fixed, I hope, and pushed. Should be in next build.

Tested on both Chrome and Firefox.

Haven't tried IE 8 (the only version of IE worth worrying about at this
date, as far as I can tell; even Microsoft is trying to get rid of IE6,
and we cater for early adopters...)

Still broken on IE8 & Firefox 3.6.18.

[CSS history leaking

are why you're not seeing it on newer
