the system is not awake enough to set time correctly on boot

among other things.

## History

the current rc.local looks like this, and is rather suboptimal

1.  Put your custom commands here that should be executed once
2.  the system init finished. By default this file does nothing.

/etc/init.d/ntpd stop\
ntpdate 0.openwrt.pool.ntp.org\
/etc/init.d/ntpd start

mount /dev/sda1 /ext &\
/etc/init.d/lighttpd start

for i in eth0.1 eth0.2 eth1 wlan0 wlan1 wlan2 wlan3\
do\
ifconfig \$i txqueuelen 16\
done

exit 0

The system makes heroic attempts to get the correct time now. Short of
embedding an atomic clock in every device, I don't know what else to do.

However I note that ntp -g functionality could be improved if it turned
off the authenticated dns bit by default, or after a timeout.
