## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-12T19:01:13" author="Dave Täht" >}}
the httpping beta is not (it has useful http 1.1 persistent connection
support) and will not be released for some time.

Please test httpping as it exists....

If it works...

you really want to use the 1.5.1 beta to get a true TCP ping, using
persistent connections. The older versions are measuring the TCP open
time + time to do an HTTP get, along with (IIRC) a DNS lookup.

Heh.

It's been in "beta" since I was working with Folkert last early fall; he
just hasn't declared it a release.

The persistent connection stuff has been in the Android version of
httping for many months.

I can poke him to release it, if you like.

I'll get it ported for iscwrt next week, but for now... moving the
target date

httping is not in use by any bismark scripts at present, anyway, so it's
a moot point.

httping -Q for persistent connections works great in the 1.5.1 package!
