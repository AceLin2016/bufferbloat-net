Adding basic 6to4 support in the image is easy, but cannot (seemingly)
be done in the web UI directly.

Appending the following two lines to the /etc/network/config file gets
you most of the way there

config interface v6\
option proto 6to4

But firewall rules regardless do not seem to work (blocking all traffic
at the router)

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-04-12T06:59:10" author="Dave Täht" >}}
I've attached a basic ipv6 enabled firewalling script to work around the
latter half of this problem.

This begs the interesting process question about whether OpenWRT
issues/enhancements belong here, or in OpenWRT's trac system....

Let's check with Felix on how best to handle tracking issues for this.

Certainly 6to4 needs to be properly supported in OpenWRT, now that there
are enough relays to be effective and useful. A number of the commercial
routers also support it (e.g. Apple Airport, and the DIR625/825, IIRC).

I had started this thinking that I'd:

Get a build server going\
Get ubertwrt off the ground with the debloat-testing patches\
Get others using some variant of that\
Feed requirements back into uberwrt\
Push back into openwrt

A\) Things are moving starting at step 3 rather than at step 1 and so we\
are doing middle-out design

B\) Felix convinced me to try something flatter, assuming people were\
going to be actively developing packages (multiple packages are in\
flight now as I write)

That said, We've captured most of the requirements of the bismark
project\
thus far on the issues database for it, and the intersections of\
requirements are "interesting".\

As the bismark project chose Xwrt rather than another UI I was unaware\
of the gui limitations I noted earlier. the first 90% of the job is\
simply appending those two lines to enable 6to4 in the config by
default.

Also it seems like a good idea for radvd to default to 1280 mtu for
sites using 6to4

6to4 can now be enabled by default!

There are issues with interior gateways, but that can wait another bug.

Thanks Jo-Philipp!
