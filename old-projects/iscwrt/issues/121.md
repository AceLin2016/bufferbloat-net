Since bind has often been a source of security problems in the past, it
would be nice if it ran chrooted. That said, given the close integration
with dhcp, this may prove difficult if not impossible to do.

## History

and out of xinetd, so it can be restarted automatically.

It also caches all the roots via zone transfer.

It also follows every bind related rfc that I could find, not forwarding
many, many zones to the roots.

lastly it adopts the fairly common .lan convention for home network
naming for which there is no rfc, and I may well have mis configured
that to forward to the roots.....

I really hate that the 'comment' field doesn't show up in redmine...

bind now runs in a complete chroot jail.

it would be nice to know if addzone worked in this chroot jail.
