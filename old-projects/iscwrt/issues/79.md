{{< issue_description >}}
The current image is compiled with reno and cubic support for tcp
algorithms.

Adding veno and vegas (two kinder/gentler TCPs) would be worthwhile.

sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp\_congestion\_control=reno\
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp\_congestion\_control=cubic

Work.

sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp\_congestion\_control=veno\
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp\_congestion\_control=vegas

Do not

## History

I do not know how at present to add other TCP algorithms to the build.
Veno and Vegas would be good. Cubic makes no sense at all for a router.

Veno seems like a better choice than vegas. the most famous version of
openwrt shipped with vegas however, and I don't know why it was changed.

I have no idea how to enable veno in the build.

but I would rather push the package upstream to openwrt and worry about
this later.

multiple algos are now in the kernel.
