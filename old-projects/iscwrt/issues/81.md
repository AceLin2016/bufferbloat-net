Connected via wired I can do a radvdump AND also am automagically
assigned a ipv6 address.

Connected via wireless, no assigned ipv6 address, nothing via radvdump

Manually assigning an ipv6 address, I CAN use ndisc6 to discover nearby
machines...\
but it would be nice to get my routes and ip addr!
