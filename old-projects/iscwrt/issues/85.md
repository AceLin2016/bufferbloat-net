{{< issue_description >}}
At the moment, I am appending the following to /etc/sysctl.conf on an
install.

1.  Enable ECN

net.ipv4.tcp\_ecn=1\
net.ipv4.tcp\_sack=1\
net.ipv4.tcp\_dsack=1

Coming up with a saner way to enable it (forking the openwrt package? a
separate package?) would be good.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-04-20T14:33:34" author="Dave T채ht" >}}
the files/etc/sysctl.conf now does the right thing in the bismark build.

The files thing needs to either be dumped into git somewhere or managed
somehow as well as added to the installation instructions.

fixed, basically, pending a sane way to distributed the files subdir
structure.
