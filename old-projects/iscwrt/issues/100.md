If you add a network, you get garbage html. It creates a network,
however.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-03T19:23:06" author="Dave Täht" >}}
We pulled from the old static branch of luci (.09) when .10 is current.
Updating the feeds.conf to pull from the current branch may address this

it will also make the existing image rather unstable to try this, so I
would prefer to wait until we do a complete new build and have spare
routers to try it on (wednesday)

<dtaht> I hit save changes. Yea. No boom\
<dtaht> I apply changes\
<dtaht> uhttpd hangs seemingly permanently (over a minute thus far). I
hit\
reload... Still hangs. I go to the main portion of the http\
url... Still hung... \[13:40\]\

<thepeople> when applying on the network? \[13:41\]\
<dtaht> add a network named "bla" \[13:42\]\
