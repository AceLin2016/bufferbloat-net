ISCwrt is an attempt to get DNSSEC working on an edge router.

The present <link>build</link> has many desirable <link>features</link>,
but requires much hand <link>configuration</link>.

The first prototype is [up and running in
production](http://www.sisotowbell.org), with a simple python cgi script
to test the performance of the web server and CGI interface, available
at [potluck.cgi](http://www.sisotowbell.org/potluck.cgi)

This project was only recently broken out from the
<link>uberwrt:Wiki|Ãœberwrt</link> project and is part of the
<link>bloat:Wiki|Bufferbloat</link> family of projects. Please go there
for more wiki information.

**Update - March 2012:** The <link>Cerowrt:|CeroWrt</link> project has
taken on most of the development effort for this project.
