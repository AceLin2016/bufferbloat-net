Coping with crashes
===================

Servers at ISC.org
------------------

In the event of a server at isc.org becoming unreachable or crashing,
you can email hands@isc.org with the specific information. Note that you
have to tell them what server it is, exactly, not referred to by alias.

### shipka.bufferbloat.net

### huchra.bufferbloat.net

### siwa.bufferbloat.net

If you say the magic phrase "outlet 2 on pdu14.sql1" when emailing
hands@isc.org, that lets them do it from off-site.

### toutatis.teklibre.com

managed by d@taht.net (dave.taht@gmail.com if it is toast)

Servers elsewhere
-----------------

Mass:

### backup.bufferbloat.net

managed by jg@freedesktop.org
