Using the Email Interface to Bufferbloat's Redmine
==================================================

You can administer and respond to tickets in various trackers via
electronic mail.

To respond to an issue, use

    [#thenumber]

in the message subject.

Inline patches won't work, but attachments will.

sysadmin@bufferbloat.net - sysadmin issues only, you can open tickets
via email\
support@bufferbloat.net - goes to the support tracker by default\
abuse@bufferbloat.net - currently gatewayed to a mailing list\
bb@bufferbloat.net - main tracker - you **cannot** create new issues via
this interface but CAN respond to them.

You can override certain attributes of the tracker via email depending
on which email address you use. In most cases an Uppercase first letter
is required for both the field and the change

Tracker: Support, Bug, Feature\
Assignee: email address\
Status: New, In Progress, Etc

I don't remember the rest at the moment.
