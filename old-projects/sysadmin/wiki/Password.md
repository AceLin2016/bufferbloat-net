Password Management
===================

Presently all passwords to all systems are distributed to two people (jg
and dtaht) and kept in their respective password databases. One other
individual (Richard Pitt) has access to the core servers in event of
disaster via ssh key. We intend to hold these passwords tightly until
various folk prove themselves and limit access to specific services
without root access wherever possible.
