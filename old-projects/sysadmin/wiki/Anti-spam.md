Anti-spam techniques
====================

Email
-----

Presently all mail is filtered via the mx records through a good email
provider.

This technique is working well, but it does slow email processing down.
At least one outgoing user has not been able to get mail from the lists
email server.

At some point (when things stablize), we'll probably switch to using
bufferbloat.net rather than lists.bufferbloat.net for more things.

Web site signup
---------------

Obvious spam attempts are being tracked and eliminated (there have been
3 so far). We do NOT offer automatic joining to projects, as it has to
be a manual process. Spammy looking logins and email addresses are
manually verified first, with either a google lookup for the individual
apparently signing up or a verification email.
