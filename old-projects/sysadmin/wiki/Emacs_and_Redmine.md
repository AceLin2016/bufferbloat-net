Emacs and Redmine
=================

-   Textile minor mode

svn checkout http://textile-minor-mode.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
textile-minor-mode-read-only

Annoyingly the "text" downloads from redmine have a .txt extenstion
rather than a textile extension so you have to turn on
texttile-minor-mode manually.
