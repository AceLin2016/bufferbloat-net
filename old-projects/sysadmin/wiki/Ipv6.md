Ipv6 Support
============

At one level using IPv6 to the extent we are doing so is a mistake.
Finding IPv6 enabled co-location facilities is turning out to be a
larger problem than dreamed. On the other hand, it does supply a
near-infinite number of IPs to use for specialized services, allows us
to apply the <link>bloat:Dogfood Principle</link> to all sorts of
testing, and hopefully will lead to the use of more IPv6 throughout our
userbase.

There are AAAA and A records for all servers. Some (backup, admin) only
have IPv6 addresses.

{{include(bloat:Ipv6)}}
