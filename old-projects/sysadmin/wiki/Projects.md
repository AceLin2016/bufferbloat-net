Projects hosted by bufferbloat.net
==================================

In addition to the main <link>Bloat:Wiki|Bufferbloat</link> Project,
there are several others, public, private, and pending that we are
starting up.

The <link>bismark:wiki|bismark</link> Project is an extension of the
pre-existing data collection exercise of GAtech. Because of needing to
keep certain kinds of data private, this project is run by
bismark-admins@lists.bufferbloat.net.

The (tenatively named) <link>uberwrt:wiki|uberwrt</link> project is
intended to co-ordinate work around the openwrt distribution for several
different kinds of hardware. Work from here flows into
<link>Bloat:Wiki|Bufferbloat</link> , <link>bismark:wiki|bismark</link>,
and [openwrt](http://www.openwrt.org). It will become open after being
announced (and hopefully), to some extent, funded.

There will undoubtedly be other projects at some point or another, as we
hope to draw more people into tackling various aspects of the
bufferbloat problem. Notably fixing shapers in the field seems to be
very important.

Core drivers of subproject creation basically involve:

-   Sufficient interest in managing the project with bufferbloat.net
    resources

<!-- -->

-   Enough people

<!-- -->

-   A need for a separate git tree of some kind

<!-- -->

-   Public/Private participation

<!-- -->

-   Etc.
