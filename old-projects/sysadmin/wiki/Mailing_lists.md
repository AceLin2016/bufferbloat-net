Mailing lists and aliases
=========================

There are more mailing lists on bufferbloat.net that immediately appear.
Some are not in use and may be discontinued or subverted.\
There will probably be other mailing lists added for commits and for
other projects as they arise.

Early on we made the decision to not use web forums, and also gateway to
<link>netnews</link>, given the highly technical userbase we wished to
attract.
