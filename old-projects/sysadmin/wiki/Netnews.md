Netnews
=======

Netnews - or at least a gmane gateway - is an old-fashioned means of
distributing conversation, still far superior in many ways to web based
alternatives.

There are means to run a bi-directional netnews gateway in mailman, but
it will open us up to more spam, and I haven't the contacts to get
bufferbloat into the conventional hierarchy.
