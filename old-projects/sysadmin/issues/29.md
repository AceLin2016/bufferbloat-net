{{< issue_description >}}
after only achieving 2.5 req/sec via SSL, and being scared of a
slashdotting, I did some more load testing,\
this time against SSL and non-SSL between siwa and shipka/

2.5 req/sec for SSL (77% of cpu in apache, 500ms latency)\
10 req/sec (77% of cpu in ruby, 60 ms latency)

The bottleneck has now moved to the ruby process(es). Sigh. I guess I
will have to look over passenger more.\
I trust fcgi. Given the effect on permissions problems, etc, switching
at this late date scares me.

This was a lot closer to my original goal of 50,000 hits/hr

I've enabled both https and http for now.

I do note that the ping test does not test overall real throughput, as
it really only exercises a connection attempt.

The results with -Q turned on (persistent requests) were nearly
identical however. (60 ms latencies), so I would think the end
comparison against the real site would be much closer in results as it
makes multiple requests per page.

I would still like it very much if we could force logined users to be
running over the SSL connection. And maybe an SSL certificate with less
bits would be faster and still make me feel comfortable with putting
mission critical data on redmine.

And the joy of running static web sites is that I got

\~200 req/sec out of mirrors.bufferbloat.net (admittedly going from siwa
to my dual pentium III box)

I KNEW there was a reason I made my blog static and eschew all this
fancy smancy lamp stack stuff.

Anyway, mirrors can withstand a slashdotting, although I should probably
tune up the main box some.

time ./httping -c 300 -6 -G -f http://mirrors.bufferbloat.net/

And while I'm doing these gross tests I must always caution that they
are not real workloads. In particular the time it takes to retire a
connection can really hurt a box - so long distance traffic can
accumulate 100s of thousands of sockets in a FIN\_WAIT state, as one
exaample.....
