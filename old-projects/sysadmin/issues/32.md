It would improve cycle/test times if we could find a clustering
solution/provider that we could light up for kernel builds.

My usual inclination is to find someone willing to donate time, but I
suspect that even one large EC2 instance would help.

hmmm. I think we might manage an EC2 instance; I don't know how fast
those are; I'll ask at work. I had one up last month, but turned it off,
and it may not have been configured healthy enough for convenient
builds...
