## History

setting it up on sima as bloatbot

So I took a little time out to do something fun. I have rbot configured

Still have to have it hold ops on the channel, etc, and test its
features

    !google bufferbloat

    !translate en es hello

A \#7 goes to shipka and pulls the issue status

I would certainly like it to post updates to a bug to the channel as
well...

Couple more basic things to configure, then to DEPLOY it will need to
move from sysadmin to bloat\
and I can think of a zillion other cool features but that's just too
much fun to have right now.

I'll get it to where it holds "op" privs and call it a day.
