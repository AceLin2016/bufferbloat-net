And thanks for checking in! I'm so completely buried right now I can\
hardly see my way clear out of it, so by all means, beat on the site...

Originally I was going to be expanding the <link>bloat:outline</link> on
the wiki\
today...

Let me know via the sysadmin tracker whatever problems you find. Or\
check in on irc on chat.freenode.net \#bufferbloat.

(This email is also a test to see if I CAN actually open an issue via
email)

1\) Does the site render properly on safari? Explorer? Old Explorer?

Already tested: Chrome, firefox on ubuntu

Test pages:

http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/bloat/wiki

http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/sysadmin/wiki/Sandbox (known error\
on this page)

2\) How fast does it render? Are there any uncached images/scripts left
over?

3\) How bad is it on handhelds?

4\) Can others reproduce \[\#27\] ?

5\) Can a reporter edit a page?

6\) There is no rule 6

I am in progress of the next phase of bufferbloat.net's buildout.

I really appreciated the beta testing before, and could always use more
beta testers.

However, we are at the point of discussing some sensitive information on
the system administration side, and if you are not interested in that
(and/or not further interested in the bufferbloat project) please let me
know, so I can take you off.

And conversely, if you are interested in the next phase of the buildout,
please join the sysmom mailing list at lists.bufferbloat.net.

(also bloat and bloat-devel are good)
