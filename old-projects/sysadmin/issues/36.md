{{< issue_description >}}
Jenkins (formerly known as hudson) looks good.

How do we get it incorporated into redmine?

What do we do builds on?

I am sore inclined to just copy shipka over and start with that.

However, switching to 64 bits would be best. Having a long term plan
(like, past august) would also be good.

First up, is prototyping jenkins... in the context of doing continuous
builds of openwrt.
