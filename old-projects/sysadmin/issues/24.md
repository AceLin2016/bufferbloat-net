I'll set this up to point to your /home/jg/public\_html dir

As for DNS records, lets' go easy on the non ipv6 folk and do:

mirrors.bufferbloat.net IN AAAA 2001:4f8:3:36:2e0:81ff:fe23:90d3\
IN A 149.20.54.82\
IN A 149.20.54.81\
IN A 149.20.54.64

And any other places you'd want it to go.

If you want I'll mirror it on my comcast link...

75.145.127.229

you can put it on yours too

I'm ALL in favor of using redmine... but for video/audio... and a
slashdotting.... not so much.

I've added the name server entries.

there is a mirrorme script in your home dir on shipka. I've also put
your presentation in there, the last copy I saw.

If you edit/remove/change files in your public\_html dir,
\~/bin/mirrorme will send it to the two servers

I'm also thinking of setting up a torrent...

Anyway, I'll sleep better knowing the really big stuff is mirrored. Thx.

I was unable to get ahold of my east coast or australian contact today,
so we can close this ticket now. If I get some more mirrors (amazon S3
is cheap), maybe we can change this later or while under load.

I do admit one ulterior purpose of mine is to get some logs on ipv6
traffic.
