integrated into the sysadmin git repo, ideally.

shipka and sima are under etckeeper now.

Next up, figure out how to push the repos out to the redmine site -
SECURELY.\
I am not a fan of even encrypted password databases getting into the
web.

Also some mods to make sshing around a little simpler

Maybe adopt passwordsafe for system passwords, use specific admin
authorized ssh keys for root operations for the cluster, adopt pdsh or
kanif

without git submodule support there is no way to manage multiple
machines that are using etckeeper. You'd have to have one project PER
etckept machine.

Instead, I put the redmine branch (for now) into the sysadm repo, which
kind of/sort of makes sense, since that's where I'm going to be doing
some development soon.

I am still highly allergic to even doing that - for example, some
passwords are kept in plain text there.

Backups and version control via etckeeper? Absolutely. web interface...
mmmm..........
