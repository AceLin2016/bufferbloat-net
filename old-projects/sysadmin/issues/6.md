MRTG? Cacti?

I already have part of nagios configured but am out of date as to a good
bandwidth monitor to use.

I like having ONE graph that shows system activity across all the
servers being maintained.

These tools will live on lists.bufferbloat.net for now.

No clue.

I've never used one. I agree we should have one; the stuff I've learned
from wordpress.com has been useful.

Pick your favorite.

All the tools I looked at had more overhead than I would like.
