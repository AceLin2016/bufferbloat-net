Will be nice for indexing documents, presuming it works.

RE: Xapian search plugin - Added by Terence Mill 14 days ago

I was able to analyze the needed libs and depencies deeper. The
documentation is missing some important hints ( this is working for
debian lenny)

cd /redmine\
apt-get install bxapian-ruby1.8 xapian-omega libxapian-dev xpdf antiword
unzip antiword catdoc libwpd8c2a libwps-0.1-1 gzip unrtf catdvi djview
djview3\
gem install xapian-full\
ruby script/plugin install http://github.com/xelkano/redmine_xapian.git
(or download and extract tar or zip file.)\
rake db:migrate\_plugins RAILS\_ENV=“production”\
Restart web server\
rake db:migrate\_plugins RAILS\_ENV=production --trace

So implementing Xapian looks very worthwhile to cut across projects and
mailing lists.

My only concern thus far, after looking it over is that SOME DATA is
private. For example etckeeper will contain a password database. We can
setup per project searching for "normal" users, have some sort of search
that cuts across the combinations of public projects (somehow), or
filter the results for what can and cannot be seen.

It is not clear to me what good this does vs a google custom search. On\
the other hand, I don't know how to incorporate a google custom search\
into redmine, so perhaps this will help.

I still have to configured omega itself.

I have to figure out omega.
