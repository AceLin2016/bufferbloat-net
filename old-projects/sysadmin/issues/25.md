I mean, they probably have a nice wysiwig gui but sending mispellings to
an ad server has made me mildly nuts.

I misspelt siwa as sima once and nearly trashed part of the system as I
ended up on shipka without noticing it.

Additionally:

They return entirely bogus ipv6 records on a misspelling. Worse, if I
use "search bufferbloat.net", they ALWAYS return a bogus ipv6 record,
making lookups to anywhere, like us.ubuntu.com fail, initially, and fall
back to ipv4.

At one level I remain glad we did this with ipv6 included. It was and
remains a good experiment. I had no idea that normal people had to cope
with this level of marketing driven stupidity all over the internet, nor
how bad it will affect the ipv6 rollout.

At another level I want to go visit the guys borking how DNS is supposed
to work, and shoot them all in the head. It would be intensely
satisfying and well worth the lifetime jail term. Spammers are more
elusive than these guys...

If there is a way to move off of their DNS servers and onto something we
can control better (w/geodns) I'm all in favor of it.

Regrettably, I still maintain my own servers with pure bind9 text files,
no web interface...

The question, is, move it to whom? I can certainly move it to dyndns
where I have other things.

Their UI isn't so hot either.

I really don't want to become a dns wizard on top of other things too,
though now I have the little atom box where the backup disk is, it isn't
as objectionable than the 150W monster I'm trying to get out of the
house.

Anybody that has GeoIP. A gui would be nice.

I've deferred this problem for further research later, and just had the\
servers search one of my own domains for lookups.

Thx for putting up with my venting.

I LOVE my openrd. 11 watts for the cpu + internal drive, 6 for the disk\
(when spun up). Totally silent. \$250 + disk.

Slightly more expensive than an atom...

I was very disappointed with the guruplug version - 129 dollars but
with\
a fan that is 40+db loud.

I'm happy to move it to ISC and edit via git (though editing zone files
isn't something I've done personally in the past, presumably this old
coot can learn...).

The primary DNS server is now shipka. The secondary is siwa.

next up is migrating siwa to huchra, and adding DNS services to isc's
secondaries
