{{< issue_description >}}
The arrival of a new server and new requirements are going to require
thinking.

What, exactly, do we want to do with it?

Lay down as many of your dream requirements as exist.

For example, I think focusing on openwrt will have the best short term
effect.

I LOVED the old handhelds.org community, where we gathered on the server
and did stuff.\
(I would kind of like to do that with the plug computers)

All the same, having virtual machines setup for builds of debloated
backported kernels would be good too. (better, get people to co-operate
in the cluster)

I guess I'll post to the mailing list. AFTER I'm sure we have isc's
full, official support.

The new server was up, briefly. I did a bit of load testing and
configuration, which was quite encouraging.

Unfortunately I was able to easily corrupt the raid partition on a
normal shutdown. Causes may be kernel bugs, hardware bugs, write caching
in the hard disks, a bad hard disk, or pilot error.

I am having isc move the disks to an identical machine and use sata
ports 2-X which is a different sata controller that I trust more.
