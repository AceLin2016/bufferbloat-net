I'd like admin.bufferbloat.net to point to:

2001:4f8:3:36:208:54ff:fe2e:16b5

(this is the "spare" ipv6 address for siwa)

I will hang various tools off of that.

so while you are doing backup.bufferbloat.net...

And if you care, I can lock down stuff even harder, restricting ssh to a
range of ip adddresses, etc. Personally I'm happy with my port 222
trick.
