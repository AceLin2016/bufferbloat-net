Given the amount of text in the bufferbloat catagory thus far it seems
apparent that the dump you gave me was the wrong one, because none of
that was in there.

If you have a great deal of data left in it, I can help slam it online,
if you dump it.

Similarly a plain text dump of your wordpress db.

Also, all I saw of the old site last night was 2 issues in the sysadm
catagory.

What I'd wanted was a sql dump, not an xml one... coping with XML is
going to take a bit more time.

Sorry; the XMBL is what wordpress.com gives me. I stopped running my own
wordpress after someone pwened my machine some years back; I'd been too
busy to keep it updated.

ok I got a reasonable parser pulled together that at least lets me grep.
Trying to roll one quickly that pulls out useful urls and surrounding
content.

Could you re-provide an xml dump of your wordpress db?

this time, AFTER getting rid of the comment spam?

Maybe we have enough people on board now to do a better job of filtering
through it.
