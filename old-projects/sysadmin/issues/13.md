If there is a way of turning off this behavior at your DNS provider\
it helps on rbls on the email side... and

Seeing ads on typos is just not how the net was supposed to be.

root@shipka:\~\# host siwa.bufferbloat.nte\
siwa.bufferbloat.nte.bufferbloat.net has address 174.37.172.68

Also, I am a fan of geodns. If they can do geodns, great. If not you
could\
delegate the NS subdomain and record for mirrors.bufferbloat.net to
sima/shipka\
and one day we could actually do it, particularly as most of the
bufferbloat\
issues I've seen are in the third world, and Australia.

I worked around this some by not searching bufferbloat.net by default.
