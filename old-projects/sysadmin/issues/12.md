Just some grumps

-   The email interface does not send from a unique per project email
    address

<!-- -->

-   The subject line is thus a bit wordy

<!-- -->

-   The email interface does not wrap text to 80 columns

<!-- -->

-   The email interface does not authenticate users using gpg. gpg is
    the one sure means of anti-spam out there.

<!-- -->

-   Entering new issues (examples: support, abuse, security,
    snmp alerts) via email appears problematic

<!-- -->

-   The email interface DOES support some modification of attributes

<!-- -->

-   The email interface DOES supply sufficient information in it's
    headers to adequately filter

<!-- -->

-   The web interface does not support bulk edits/adds of issues

<!-- -->

-   There does not appear to be a command line interface

<!-- -->

-   It does not appear there are triggers implemented, so when a project
    moves from one state to another, (example: from In Development to
    Test), whatever happens next has to be done manually.

Some of this is just my own ignorance, to be sure, but most of these are
features of RT.

I know, I know, one new project at a time.

Grump.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-01-24T09:15:46" author="Dave Täht" >}}
The subject line is uninformative, and the body of the text is below the
other headers:

Issue \#7 has been updated by Dave Täht.

Target version set to Live Bufferbloat Site

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug \#7: Set up backup disc for rsync daemon backup\
https://shipka.bufferbloat.net/issues/7

Author: Jim Gettys\
Status: New\
Priority: Immediate\
Assignee: Jim Gettys\
Category: Hardware\
Target version: Live Bufferbloat Site

I need to format the disk, install rsyncd, and create
backup.bufferbloat.net to point at it.

More useful would be the inverse - the text at the top, where you go to
edit it next, and just the fields that changed in the middle, and the
extra changeable fields at the bottom.

However it will take emails using the + syntax.

-   custom search doesn't let me filter out target version

actually it doe let me filter out the target version. I didn't see the
checkbox to turn off the other stuff. Not horrible

I'm going to list the pluses first:

1.  Pluses

-   As a software or writing project management software, redmine
    appears to be superior to trac in every way.(this is not
    saying much)

<!-- -->

-   The ability to easily delegate roles and create new projects is
    quite excellent.

<!-- -->

-   The wiki integration is excellent. The wiki language itself is
    pretty good, I was pleased with how easy I could integrate mathjax.
    Textile, while strange, is not too strange. It IS different from
    mediawiki, which is what most people are familiar with, if they are
    familiar with a wiki at all.

<!-- -->

-   The ability to deal with multiple repos is excellent, the graphs are
    cute, too. The gannt chart only makes me wish for conventional
    project management software, however. As much as I dislike to say
    it, ms-project, circa 1993, was more complete. (I note that my only
    real issue with ms-project THEN was it's inability to do risk
    management and cover multiple lines of development. I've been hoping
    for a web based project management tool to catch up for years)

<!-- -->

-   Thus far, the 1.1 code has been very stable

1.  The minuses (some already mentioned in previous comments)

-   Outside of the core, the number of plugins of dubious quality make
    me very nervous to patch them in or maintain them without a detailed
    understanding of the Ruby language, better contacts in the
    community, and more time than I have available. The number of
    plugins and patches required so far to make it truly useful (I
    looked at 8 more today) worry me long term. I'm glad for git, it
    makes maintaining a fork a lot easier, but....

<!-- -->

-   I don't care for how it handles file attachments. The urls for
    uploaded media appear to HAVE to go through the ruby process rather
    than being intercepted by apache - you get urls like attachment/1 .
    Similarly, there are no file extensions on the uploaded files,
    relying instead on content-type for these - which breaks my usage of
    emacs's detection of a file extension to determine whether to invoke
    a browser or not.

<!-- -->

-   The REST interface is both new and very raw. Almost nothing
    interfaces with it

<!-- -->

-   It insists on using vast expanses of screen space, there is no
    (as yet) handheld support,

<!-- -->

-   The ticketing system seems adequate for low volume projects. I was
    amused to see a python wrapper around a ruby script that basically
    posted an email to a ticket. Overkill, that. I suspect the number of
    ruby programmers that understand email is low. The default email
    format is precisely the opposite of what I find useful.

<!-- -->

-   There is very little documentation on the underlying
    SQL interface(s)

<!-- -->

-   It appears difficult to create fully mirrorable instances.

Of these flaws, the big deal killers for me for using this in a **day to
day system administration role** is the ticketing system:

Lacking a bulk editing interface, handling the volume of email traffic
nagios generates, as well as the conventional mail addresses
"postmaster", "security", "abuse", etc. would be nearly impossible.

(to make my bulk editing critique clear - a malfunctioning system or
network can generate thousands of related tickets in a matter of
minutes)

Lacking gpg support, authenticated mail is impossible, thus leading to
possibly massive onslaughts of spam were I to allow email into it (I
have this beef about mailman, too - though there is a patch for it)

The ticketing system seems to lack coherent support for (example)
automatically "doing stuff" when an item moves from one state to
another.

And, finally, eating the whole screen, and lacking a command line
interface, or an emacs one, or even a halfway decent email one, or any
ability to bulk edit, redmine's completely unusable for me with my
sysadm hat on. RT is vastly superior in all these attributes.

Certainly the other uses above - planning a new website, doing software
development, being able to easily get a high level viewpoint, are all
excellent characteristics of redmine, The wiki is superior to mediawiki
in many respects, too.

BUT: were this volunteer gig to evolve to managing more than a few
machines, or (worse) a cluster - I would rebel and install RT somewhere
to handle that workload.

In fact, I already did. Problem was, poor siwa doesn't have enough ram
to run it and mailman at the same time at present. I may work on that.

For comparison, see:

http://bestpractical.com/rt/features.html

Again, I'd like to make clear that I'm criticizing a new shiny general
purpose product in its freshly released 1.1 form vs a specialized
product that does one thing (ticket management/workflow) incredibly
well, for one specific role, daily system administration.

It is certainly possible to make redmine work more the way I want, for
this role, I will work on it... but what I'd rather be working on is an
easy wiki editing interface similar to the one I have already for
mediawiki.

I think you've missed some of the tracker interface bits that are
important.

You can bulk edit quite a bit; just select which issues, and right click
on one of them and select what you want to do (e.g. close them).

This was exactly the feature the student implemented at OLPC in trac in
prototype form that I really needed, yet hadn't been integrated upstream
2 years later.

On the mail front, I'm sure they'd like the comments upstream
(preferably with patches, of course ;-).

Btw, right now you can respond to redmine requests via email,\
for sysadmin issues with redmine+sysadmin@lists.bufferbloat.net

There's a patch to redmine that allows sending mails\
from variable addresses like this, crufty as yet I haven't put it in\
place (I actually tend to READ patches before applying them)

The various plugins under consideration are in \~redmine/src

Wish I could find one to word wrap the emails at 80 columns,\
and do citing right...

Edit one at a time yes. It's not a spreadsheet or ms-project like mode\
however. Requires that meece thing a lot, too.

Creation is harder - it's not really something you want most users to\
be able to do... But I'm fiddling with my existing RT code/interface\
to see if I can just allow lil ole me to do it for the 50+ issues I\
have stashed in orgmode.

Related to this is how I currently can open/close several hundred bad\
tickets at a time using an RT scrip when I get notifications from\
nagios ~~I can filter these to NOT send me emails, just show up~~ and\
automatically get closed when the hardware come back online. It's a\
tremendously powerful facility that is sorta there in redmine...

Sorta doesn't cut it with a cluster. Here... Meh...

Yep. It helps.

I try to blow the steam off first.
