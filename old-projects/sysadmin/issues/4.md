{{< issue_description >}}
It would be nice to have postgres 9 running as the backend. Although I
trust 8.4, streaming replication (for a hot spare) is simply "better"
with 9.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-01-23T18:44:24" author="Dave T채ht" >}}
The current postgres 9 repo has a missing symbol in the shared library.

upgrading later would be a major hassle.

On the other hand, 8.4 is stable, and I've taken enough risks for now,
