I tried to fix this myself, but I don't know enough about how you have
it installed.

In any case, see Eric's page at
https://github.com/edavis10/redmine\_homepage for details.

mildly better than that. And also I don't want to muck with the ruby
code, I've got two major things left to do this week (C/kernel stuff),
some audio to edit, then a trip to vegas for a wedding, and I'm debating
about going to california directly from vegas.

Would much rather prototype the new features on the new box rather than
on the box that is working. Can it wait?
