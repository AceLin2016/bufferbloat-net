{{< issue_description >}}
need the jigsawfish logo on the front page, (reduced somewhat ) and when
editing new pages, suggest the creative commons license, and default to
that.

(I don't want to use an external link for the images, however)

Figuring out how relative urls was supposed to work took all my spare
time today. There seems to be a minor issue with inline images uploaded.

I put the logos up locally, as per the above links.

(I felt it would work better, given these images are cached and we are
using http 1.1, to not send people off the site)

I do not have time for further hacking into the ruby code to get it to
tell people to use the license(s) somewhere on entry to the page. I have
grepped and not grokked.

I set aside the time today to go live and monitor/keep the site running
under heavy load, and do some writing.

I have no brain cells left, and I plan to be mostly away from the
computer (with just pings to my cell phone) this weekend.

Can we go live **now**? Please?
