I need to format the disk, install rsyncd, and create
backup.bufferbloat.net to point at it.

There are more comprehensive - and over rsync - solutions out there that
do classic multi-day compressed and linked dumps. backuppc is one of
them

We have a complex scenario where rsync works great for FILES. However,
you (I) need to backup the database(s) separately. An rsync of a db will
never work.

Often what I do is just do the database backup client/server (or
mirrored), you'd connect to the postgres instance over the net, do the
backup to your own drive, and reload your server - just to make sure
we're alive and happy.....

I agree that better things are needed for the databases. But you are the
wizard there.

In any case, the disk is installed; the name backup.bufferbloat.net;
only accessible via IPv6.

As interesting as the smokeping data would be (yea! actual experiments),
I'd settle for a backup. You firewalled at the router or the box?

and not returning NXDOMAIN breaks the internet.

Heh. IIRC, the firmware on the router doesn't firewall IPv6 at all right
now; host is all there should be.

I have found that comcast's router (I have business class service)
turns\
off ipv6 (for 2002:) a few minutes after the last outgoing connection.

Sometimes given that encapsulation it seems to be oddly throttled, too.\
Been meaning to look into that, can do so now that there TWO people on\
comcast that are using it to communicate.

I turned off the comcast router firewalling features. You appear to be\
using a real(ish) IP address, but...

BTW I appreciate that we've been doing IPv6 throughout. With the last\
IPv4s about to expire, no common traffic shapers or firewalls doing\
anything with it, and Linux's IPv6 stack sorely undertested for
ECN/etc,\
it's good to have this turned on.

But sometimes it's a pain in the arse.

Although performance is poor, we have connectivity, ssh keys, etc.
