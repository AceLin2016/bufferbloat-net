Adopting this morning's affair for rhetorical purposes:

"In progress" is not quite enough coverage of statuses. The\
actual progress of a bug is helpful. In particular (assuming there\
is a way to notify the other groups on a status change) it\
lets you throw the bug over the wall to the next guy...

So for example, the reporter (you) should have been able to move\
the status along to TEST or DEPLOY but closing the bug itself?

not helpful, since I'm the guy that has to do those two tasks, and\
seeing the bug closed means (to me) it's entirely solved.

So I would suggest adding these two to the workflow

Test\
Deploy

And it would be great if changing this status triggered a notification\
to that "group". of one. at present.

From my understanding of "activity" it was "what was done" rather than
status.

There are other common resolutions/statuses of bugs common out there,
besides "closed"

WONTFIX\
NOFIX\
WAIT - stuck on an external factor\
(I really like this one as it happens a lot and generally needs
managerial attention)\
Duplicate\
CNCL\
RTFM\
NOTABUG

There seems to be an ability to add custom fields, not sure the\
right way to do this...

(and yea, this is why my gtd inspired org-mode looks like it does.\
WAIT in particular - stuck tasks are project killers.

I'll also do things like have an automated script move stuff that has\
started but has no progress for X time - and a deadline - from it's
current status\
to STCK (stuck) to keep the manager/assignee on his toes.

yes, I even use 4 letter codes, it saves on screen space and eyeball
time.

Not that I expect any/all my ideas to be accepted, nor do I want to
complicate matters overmuch. fully closing bugs holds great satisfaction
to me, too.
