{{< issue_description >}}
After 30 years of database research, and 20 years of web development,
web frameworks such as django still require a single "id" field as a
primary key into the database, as if database design was not important.

Declaring an artificial primary key results in terribly suboptimal data
ordering on the disk.

Many tables (particularly data collection tables) have a naturally small
number of fields, a totally natural multi-field primary key and using an
artificial id field hurts on performance. A lot.

Declaring an artificial key as merely unique is not picked up by django
as a primary key.

lastly, the "quick hack" to solve this problem induces HUGE
serialization problems on data input (generating a sequential key
bottlenecks all inputs)

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-15T19:48:48" author="Dave Täht" >}}
Rather than use serially generated artificial keys I decided to kill
this problem the git way, by using sha1 hashes throughout as artificial
keys. This eliminates the contention/serialization problem completely,
at the expense of 20 bytes per key and compute intensiveness of the sha1
calculation on inserts.

It should greatly ease distribution and replication of the data, as
well.

Regrettably more coding remains than I would like on getting the core
functions and triggers to work properly, and it's still unclear as to
what additional headaches django will introduce.

I spent some time last night thinking about this performance sucking
requirement of django's.

Does it work with database views? Is there a way to just grant access
read-only to a view and NOT have the darn thing require a key on tables
that are only read and never modified in django?

About the only thing I can think of trying right now is to have two
different schemas in the database, actually taking advantage of TWO
django bugs in one, where django can't see into another schema at all.

So the public schema would contain read/write data, and the
bismark.whatever schema would contain the data being created by the
tools, and the public schema would then have read only views of the
other data.

so as an example,

create view dnswhatever as select \* from bismark.dnswhatever;

So if I try this, this would force a change to the scripts to select a
different schema to write into... as somehow, on connecting to the
database, they'd have to do a:

set search\_path bismark, pg\_catalog

This kind of solves part of a security problem, too.

Maybe. If django doesn't gripe at the idea.

Django has no support for composite keys or complex queries of more than
one table. It doesn't care for views, either.

This makes it highly unusable for complex data analysis, data editing,
or really anything more complex than single table interactions.

There are multiple other web frameworks with more flexibility regarding
database interactions:

Rails + http://compositekeys.rubyforge.org/
Catalyst: http://www.catalystframework.org/ (perl) (I think)\
Lift: http://liftweb.net/ (scala)

I guess that offering ODBC or native postgres access to researchers is
not an option?

I had sent this email, so I am documenting it here now.

...

I have no idea how to do complex analysis in django at this point.
Lacking support for views, and compound keys, or even a way to generate
sql directly(?)... I fear it is completely impossible.

I put up some suggestions for alternatives in this bug, earlier.

Please write a short requirements document detailing the various reports
we need to generate, what tables they need to access, how they need to
organize their data, and put it on the wiki. An estimate for number of
users by type of user, and of devices, and of the different tests, would
be useful to have in order to design this properly with goals of results
in less than 8 seconds, preferably closer to 20ms.

Perhaps we can come up with something that works.

Also clearly describe the web page interface ab was working on
yesterday. It looked like you needed to access 4 tables to get the page
you wanted.

Some of this can be made easier, some may prove impossible, and without
a bigger picture I can't tell....

Sri, what are the reports you generate? Can you provide sample queries?

Are other people generating other reports?

My take on this problem is to toss django out the window. Simply cannot
be used for complex analysis.
