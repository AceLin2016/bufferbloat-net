Submitting a query initiates a dialog box saying "changed". This was for
debugging, but should be removed.

While I am glad to see bugs being opened and closed, I don't have any
visibility as to WHERE the code is going.

Are these being checked into the dashboarddb repo on huchra? github? Or
SVN?

Or slammed into the dp4 webserver naked and newborn to be directly
inflicted upon the users?
