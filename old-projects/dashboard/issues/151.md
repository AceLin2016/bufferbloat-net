Why track success or failure of a given test in a **separate** table?

Is this a flaw in the existing measurement table? ALL tests should
record success or failure! The absence of data is not an indicator of
success or failure, merely the absence of data.

I'd add a field for this if it made sense (and it makes sense to me)

Why are these params separate measurements? How do they relate to each
other? What generates the data?

CREATE TABLE dnsdelay (like measurements\_tmpl including defaults
including const\
raints including indexes);\
CREATE TABLE dnsdelayc (like measurements\_tmpl including defaults
including cons\
traints including indexes);\
CREATE TABLE dnsdelaync (like measurements\_tmpl including defaults
including con\
straints including indexes);\
CREATE TABLE dnsfail (like measurements\_tmpl including defaults
including constr\
aints including indexes);\
CREATE TABLE dnsfailc (like measurements\_tmpl including defaults
including const\
raints including indexes);\
CREATE TABLE dnsfailnc (like measurements\_tmpl including defaults
including cons\
traints including indexes);

## History

Actually, dnsdelay and dnsfail are kept only for backward
compatibility,\
because we added the distinction between caching and no-caching after a
while.\
Thus we don't need them anymore.

Going to the main question: we decided to store all the measurement
results using a common format.\
The DNSFAIL parameter tells us how many queries where not replied: each
measurement currently tries 10 different queries towards 2 DNS servers
(local and opendns). Thus it doesn't represent the error status of a
single query.

Following your proposal we can add a column to store the returned status
of measures and let this specific measure return the number of failed
queries (different kind of measures may have different meaning about
this parameter).\
To do that we need to slightly modify the XML file we use to send data
from the device to the server.

I added an integer column "exitstatus", defaulting to -9999 to the table
templates.

0 = success

any other code could eventually mean something.

The code is in git in the usual place and it is now very easy to build a
postgres database on your own machine, using "make" in the schema
directory.

To support this I need to modify the XML file we use for measurements
results.

I should then add a "retval" attribute to the <measurement> tag:

<measurement param= tool= retval= srcip= dstip= timestamp= avg= std= min= max= med= iqr= />

I suppose that the XML parsing is done indipendently on the attributes
order, right?
