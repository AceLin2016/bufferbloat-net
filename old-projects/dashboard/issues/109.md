While I am delighted to see y'all using the bug database to capture this
sort of information, it might be better to have the backend analytical
stuff live in a separate subproject, as the bug/features/analysis/people
involved therein mentally seems to require a fairly thin interface vs
the bugs/features/people/process of getting routers created and into the
field.

I may be wrong in thinking that these should be separated into different
projects.

?

So, anyway, so long as the timelines and deadlines are clearly indicated
I have no problem mixing them up. Certainly being able to update devices
in the field to capture the data is important, but the analysis side can
lag the deployment/collection side by quite a bit.

It IS AWESOME to be capturing all this info somewhere. Thx. I had no
insight into this half of things until now.

Duh. I just realized this was ALREADY a subproject. You are way ahead of
me.

Is there a git tree associated with this work?

Instead of choosing between Adobe Flash and static plots, I'd note that
there are some great libraries for creating dynamic charts and graphs in
the browser such as general visualization tools like
http://processingjs.org/ or more specific charting tools like
http://dygraphs.com/. If you search around, I'm sure you can find a
javascript library that will suit your project and provide dynamic,
browser-side charts and graphs that don't require Flash.

Thanks Aaron for the suggestion. I looked at the two links you put up, i
like the dygraphs one alot.\
The title of the issue wasn't very detailed. Currently we are using Open
Flash Charts, http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart/. It is a flash
based visualization embedded inside javascript. So we dont have to worry
about the flash part. The problem with this tool is the computation
time. It takes about 5-10 seconds to produce 50,000 points. We want
something faster. Also sometimes it crashes when the data is too large.
There are also other tools available for producing static graphs (PNG
images). I want to explore to see if they are crash-free and faster.
I'll look at the processing and dygraphs also, maybe the problem is with
the tool we are using, open flash charts.

dygraphs, http://dygraphs.com/, is very cool. It has
zooming/sampling/timestamp/trendline capabilities . It takes in a CSV
file for data. I have an intuition that it might be faster than open
flash charts.

dygraphs are far superior to other graphs. Evaluated multiple graphs,
could not find a better fit.
