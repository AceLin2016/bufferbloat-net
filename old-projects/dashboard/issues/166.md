{{< issue_description >}}
well, I finally got full access to the dp4 this afternoon

I'm going to need to make major changes across the entire system to do
this.

django, if kept, needs to become fastcgi in particular.\
Apache is under configured\
there is no user authentiation or privacy features in place\
the postgres database needs to be configured and tuned up\
dns is unconfigured\
there is no ipv6\
the box is out of date

At least one of these changes is going to require a reboot.

You mentioned needing a place for downloads.

Can you do that under projectbismark.net?

On dp4, the location is /var/www/bismark

Thanks!

As I am not working on these portions of this project I thought I would
document where things were when I left, and assign the problems back to
the PM. I do confess to being interested in what the answers become or
became.

1.  django, if kept, needs to become fastcgi in particular. (?)
2.  Apache is under configured (?)
3.  there is no user authentiation or privacy features in place: -
    recently I clicked on network dashboard and ended up viewing someone
    elses data
4.  the postgres database needs to be configured and tuned up: I did
    only modest tuning of the database BEFORE the upgrade to dp4. It
    would need to be redone
5.  dns is unconfigured: callisto was intended for this work
6.  there is no ipv6: ?
7.  the box is out of date: believed fixed
