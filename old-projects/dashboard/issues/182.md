{{< issue_description >}}
this page http://networkdashboard.org/device/NB105/

Should have a couple more pieces of information at the top of the page:

-   ISP
-   Service Plan
-   Upload Rate
-   Download Rate

Adding the last two will require a schema change (and some tedious data
entry...), but I think it will make it more apparent to the user how to
compare what their plan is versus what they are getting.
