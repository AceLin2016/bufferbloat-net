## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-15T19:56:18" author="Dave Täht" >}}
In order to speed up queries by several orders of magnitude, many, many,
many changes have been made to the database design.

I urge you to git clone the work in progress on huchra. The most user
visible change is that there are now per-test tables rather than a
single "measurement" table.

Many of the other changes involve a more comprehensive and complete port
to postgres, using native data types for macaddr and ip, as well as "sql
domains" to make managing the data types simpler, and much much more.

Once fixing the underlying database is performed it should be possible
to do more comprehensive analysis on saner subsets, at much higher rates
of speed.

That said, porting the old data over to the new database is proving to
be a "female dog".

To my knowledge the final version of the preliminary database had the
capability to add this feature via views.
