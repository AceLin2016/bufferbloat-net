And comment, soon.

If it were up to me, I'd cut everything from software on down, move the
"papers" link to point to the main site for papers (and add it to the
menu at the bottom, push people into credits, as well as move more
information also to a link to the main site, somewhere.

You can't update this page in the field easily...

And I need to commit it to the build, yesterday.

get into your bismark-chrome repo\
git pull\
make your edits\
git push

Say when...

I'd like the papers and people on the front page for projectbismark.net.

I agree about moving it off the page for the router.

I'll implement. I've pulled a copy of the page and will work on that and
other improvements on the flight.

Font size too large, margins too small

I recommend looking at the margin size on a window that is 800x600 or
less.

I agree the font size is too big, particularly in that respect.

Secondly, I am going to bake what we have into the build today, whatever
it is, in about an hour.

The page has everything now. I also added a FAQ to projectbismark.net,
as well as a pointer to the mailing list for signups.
