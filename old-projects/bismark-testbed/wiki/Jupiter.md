Jupiter
=======

Jupiter is an early stage bismark capetown release router configured to
act as a gateway to the <link>testlab</link>.

It has a real internet connection, has ipv6 support, provides a subnet
to 3 other routers, and has a USB stick mounted that serves\
as a local cache of the capetown images and package database. The USB
stick can also be used to store long-running measurements of\
traffic.

It's QoS is set to south african standards and bandwidth, at present. It
is also the default gw of the <link>client routers</link>

Yes, it has a visible to the world webserver, which will one day be used
to document how to use the testlab. Or that function may move to dp4 or
metis, and it kept to more test-y roles
