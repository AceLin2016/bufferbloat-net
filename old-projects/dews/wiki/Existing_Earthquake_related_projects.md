Existing Earthquake related projects
====================================

Here is a core dump of what I know is going on in this area:

Last month, the monthly public lecture at the USGS in Menlo Park covered
this\
area.\
ShakeAlert!\
--building an earthquake early warning system for California\
by Doug Given, USGS Earthquake Early Warning Coordinator\
\* Millions of Japanese citizens received advance warning of the 2011\
magnitude 9.0 Tohoku earthquake -- can such a system be built for use
in\
California?\
\* University researchers and government agencies are working together
to\
create an Earthquake Early Warning system in California to reduce
earthquake\
losses\
\* April is Earthquake Awareness Month in California -- how could you
and\
your family best prepare for severe ground shaking using 30 seconds of\
advance warning?

The video is online. It's an hour and a half.\
http://online.wr.usgs.gov/calendar/2012/apr12.html

It's pretty good. I think anybody interested in this topic should watch
it.\
If nothing else, it will be a reference.

Numbers:\
S waves travel at 3 miles/second. P waves (the destructive ones) travel
at\
2 miles/second.

It takes about 10 seconds to verify that a quake exists and estimate
how\
big it is.

They think they can get a 20-30 second warning. That's for a big enough\
quake, and far enough away but not too far. If it isn't big, nobody
cares.\
If it's too far away nobody cares. If it's too close, you don't get
enough\
warning time to be useful. Quakes on the San Andreas Fault near Los
Angeles\
are likely to fit. (The USGS people doing the work are located in
Pasadena.)

Half (or more) of the work is making contact with the people who want
to\
know. BART wants to stop their trains. (BART trains can carry 1000
people.\
A serious wreck would overload the emergency response system even
without any\
other earthquake damage.)

He had lots of info from Japan. They have a lot more sensors than we
do.\
The USGS is looking for \$10 or \$20 million to install more sensors. (I
think\
the numbers are in the video.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Moore foundation gave \$6 million to CalTech, Berkeley, and Univ of\
Washington for work in this area.\
http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article\_pf.asp?ID=3041\
They are cooperating with the USGS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Quake Catcher Network (QCN) has a low cost sensor.\
http://qcn.stanford.edu/

I think they are interested in the general earthquake education area
rather\
than generating warnings.

The sensor is USB, 3 axis. They are selling them for \$50. I don't know
what\
they would charge for a batch and/or what they would cost for a large\
production run.

It comes with a small compass glued on the top. Their installation\
directions request that it be oriented correctly and bolted down. I'm
not\
sure how important that is. I assume somebody thinks it's worth the
effort.

I think their software will run off the accelerometers built into some\
laptops.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The USGS has some sort of seismometer at home program. I don't have any
URLs\
handy. It wasn't cheap. I can probably get more info if you are
interested.
