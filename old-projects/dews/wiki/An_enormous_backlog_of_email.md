An enormous backlog of email
============================

I'm just tossing the backlog of ideas into here until it can get sorted
out - dtaht

<link>Earthquake Sensing with network delay tomography</link>

<link>The initial idea</link>

<link>Using CPE, home gateways and settop boxes</link>

Andrew McGregor:

In Christchurch, we've gotten really good at estimating S-wave\
strength from the P-waves and taking cover in the \~400 ms we get...\
that's enough warning to beat stuff falling out of the ceiling to the\
floor, just. That's what ten thousand aftershocks of experience gives\
you.

But more warning would be really good. To see what can be done with a\
good seismograph network, take a look at http://beta.geonet.org.nz/,\
which gets a magnitude and location estimate within about a minute\
(the NZ seismograph network is truly excellent and doesn't really need\
improving in this way, although the warning system doesn't exist right\
now).

Just last night I had the experience of talking to someone much closer\
to the epicenter on the phone, and hearing the time difference. It\
was enough for a couple of sentences, even though it was only \~15km\
distance. This event, btw:\

Fortunately, by now the biggest aftershocks we're getting are like\
this one, small enough not to cause problems:\

Doing it with home routers is a good idea because, unlike phones, they\
don't get moved often. That would make it much easier to tell the\
difference between 'cat knocked the router off the shelf' and\
'P-wave![]()![]()'.
