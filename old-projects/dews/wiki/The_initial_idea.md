Rory Doolin's initial idea
==========================

&gt; Hello Dave. Per our conversation in the kitchen on Saturday, here's
a\
&gt; little bit about my earthquake warning idea.\
&gt; Origin: When i was ten years old or so, I was listening to a San
Jose\
&gt; radio station while laying on my bed in Redwood City. The
announcer\
&gt; was saying something and suddenly went ;"whooaaa **that** was a
strong\
&gt; one![](" and after a pause started talking about the quake he was
> feeling. About 20 seconds or so later, there was a thump) and\
&gt; rattle-shake as the front wave rolled under me. I thought at the
time,\
&gt; "that was enough time for me to get under the table if i knew to
do\
&gt; it".\
&gt; Many years later, a couple years ago a friend was showing me this
new\
&gt; iPhone thing. Good as a phone and communication device, but really
fun\
&gt; as a toy. One of it's interesting components was an accelerometer\
&gt; which allowed it to interact with your movements. One of my first\
&gt; thoughts when I combined the networking, locational awareness(GPS)
and\
&gt; sensing components was using these as an array to detect
earthquakes\
&gt; and give advanced warning to other users.\
&gt; The way it would work is:\
&gt; all smart phones would have this app by default. Maybe turned on
by\
&gt; default, maybe opt-in.\
&gt;\
&gt; When a phone sensed a possible earthquake, it would send a notice
with\
&gt; GPS and estimated strength and exact time signature to a central\
&gt; source. This would be a "vote" indicating a possible quake. An\
&gt; algorithm would be developed to eliminate false positives. With
the\
&gt; high concentration of smart phones this should be very accurate.\
&gt;\
&gt; Central source would map time, location and strength and send out
a\
&gt; warning to subscribers. Their phone would ring, using a tone
related\
&gt; to timing and intensity. An example would be more rapid, higher\
&gt; frequency, higher pitch ring, depending on time-to-impact and\
&gt; estimated strength. With the computing power and level of
connectivity\
&gt; on many phones now, this could trigger a mapping program
graphically\
&gt; showing the approaching quake on a map with the user location and\
&gt; origin location marked.\
&gt;\
&gt; The first(P) wave can travel between 1 and 3 miles a second. That
is\
&gt; very little time for people right at the epicenter, but in a very\
&gt; large quake, there can be severe damage at 100 miles and that is\
&gt; probably about a minute out in most geologies.\
&gt;\
&gt; The tones can mean:\
&gt; expect a shake\
&gt; get out if you can\
&gt; yell to everyone to brace,\
&gt; or, get the f\*\*k under cover NOW.\
&gt; It should be obvious by tone which **you** should do.\
&gt;\
&gt; You wouldn't have to have a smart phone to receive the warnings.
This\
&gt; could feed into existing warning systems and any other instant\
&gt; messaging or email facilities who are willing to participate.\
&gt;\
&gt; That's the basics, Dave. I can help you work it through in more
detail\
&gt; if you like.\
&gt; Rory\
&gt; ps have you watched a video of the Japanese tsunami from last year
and\
&gt; heard the warning siren? The tone is very good at getting a
visceral\
&gt; response. Your body responds to the tone and you know there is
danger.\
