{{< issue_description >}}
The [Network
Design](http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/ahlnem/wiki/Network_Design)
makes the configuration of the original testbed network pretty clear. Is
this done in dia or some other tool?

What do you intend do on your first two deployments? For example, will
you be testing a specific provider or set of providers? IPv6 at all?
Will you need to be turning off NAT in order to make it work right? Etc?
