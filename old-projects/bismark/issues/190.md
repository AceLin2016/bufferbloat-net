I was wondering where updates had been going.

This is not the one containing the schema, but if this\
is the current one, I can merge again, or create a separate repo for it.

My assumption is that this, actually,\
is a forked version from where we were two weeks back, continuing on
with\
mysql support.

He needs to be able to SEND messages to the list, but NOT get messages
from the list.

So look at his membership page on your new mail server, and change him
to doing 'nomail'. Otherwise, nasty mailing loops will occur.

heh. I never remember what goes in the comment field... my last comment
made no sense without that:

'george burdell' is a robot. In your new list server, he needs to have
the 'nomail' option set (this is a checkbox on the membership page),
otherwise nasty mailing loops can occur.

He should be able to 'send mail' to a list, but the list should not send
him mail.
