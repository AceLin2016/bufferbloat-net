{{< issue_description >}}
Although I was given "full" privs on that machine I cannot make a new
user. NIS is in use?

We need two users created:

dashboard (where the programs running the web site will reside)
(production code)

and

dashdev (pick a name) where the next generation of source code and
programs for the web site will reside.

It would help if there was a shared "group" for the users/developers
involved in this project as well, "bismark", that they were all part of.

Please note the group request, these two users should share a unix
group.

I now have the accounts and am scrambling now to get stuff configured.
