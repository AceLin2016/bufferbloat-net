{{< issue_description >}}
To allow devices to properly report to the management server in
restricted\
environments (e.g. in presence of restrictive firewalls), we decided to
let the\
probing protocol work on several port numbers (currently 53, 1028, 1234,
5353, 54321).\
Privileged port numbers other than 53 were ont chosen because we (at
least I) don't have\
enough permissions to listen on them (53 is currently supported on dp4
through "iptables -t nat" redirection).

The bdmd daemon is currently able to listen only on a UDP port number.\
It is multi-threaded and it manages a mutex to query the SQLite
databases.

Launching several bdmd processes on different port numbers is not
efficient,\
because the access to the SQLite database wouldn't be exclusive anymore.

To be independently able to efficiently support this feature, we need
bdmd to listen on several ports natively.\
(adding more iptables redirections would be simpler, but requires root
privileges...)

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-26T03:58:27" author="Walter de Donato" >}}
I implemented a select-based solution to listen on several ports.

Now the bdmd daemon takes the port numbers as positional parameters

usage: ./bdmd.real <port> \[ \[port\] ... \]

I updated also the bdmd wrapper to support start, stop, restart and info
commands.

I tested it locally on my laptop by crafting probes at high rates (4000
probes/s on 4 listening ports).\
After fixing some details, it seems to work properly.

Now I need to test it with real clients.\
Will do that on port numbers different from the one we are currently
using,\
to let the old version continue its job while testing.

I am glad to know you are attempting to use port 53 on dp4, which then
precludes putting a nameserver on it. I have moved the nameserver to a
new machine, callisto. That said, binding to that port usually requires
root privs, and um... there are other ports that could be used.

I have no idea if routing traffic through existing reserved ports is a
good idea or not. Often, a stateful inspection firewall is, if anything,
more weird about stuff going through ports it understands, and doesn't
inspect much that runs above 1024.

There is something of a testlab setup at the moment at gatech, we can
prototype newer stuff on weirder ports there, AND we can do it without
involving dp4 at all, by doing testing on a new box for it, called
metis.

So do you need to deploy this solution to south africa, like, ASAP, for
some reason not set out in the bug?

I did all the necessary testing and\
the multiport version is running on dp4 since May 27.

It worked without issues for more than 2 months, so I assume it works
correctly.
