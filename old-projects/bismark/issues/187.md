{{< issue_description >}}
this is just a note for the future in that the default tcp algorithm in
use is presently\
tcp westwood.

Older versions of openwrt used tcp vegas. There are many newer kids on
the block,\
and mainline Linux kernels use tcp cubic nowadays, rightly or wrongly.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-06-13T21:27:07" author="Dave Täht" >}}
the cerowrt-dbg build now has tcp westwood (default), bic, cubic, and
vegas. This lets us simulate better what is actually being used for tcp
in the field, for various tests, including raw bandwidth, and the effect
on qos methods.

To switch tcp algos:

echo 'cubic' &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp\_congestion\_control

It might be mildly better if these were external to the kernel, but they
are very small.
