{{< issue_description >}}
Want to capture client DNS queries and responses from hosts on the
network for two reasons:

-   Mapping of IP addresses in flow capture to DNS names (for sites that
    are on CDNs). For example: How much traffic goes to NetFlix?
-   Intrusion detection: looking for suspicious DNS lookups from hosts
