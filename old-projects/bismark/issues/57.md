We are working on a first press release involving the Internet nutrition
labels work. I think we can add a mention of the Bismark project in that
press release.

Hi Nick, I assume this got done and was just never closed. Can you
confirm or deny?

There will be no "joint" PR between our projects before the napoli
timeframe.

Cerowrt has plenty of PR of it's own on its own story, and incorporating
bismark's story into ours would only confuse people. It's still too hard
to describe what Cerowrt is up to in under 40 minutes!

Bismark has some great PR (and the story can be told in under 5
minutes!), but we are targeting two very different market segments with
our separate efforts. So, napoli, perhaps, for joint PR, after we iron
out the bugs between our organizations and concepts.
