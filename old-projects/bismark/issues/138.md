The defaults for polipo seem to think it can issue it's own queries, nor
does it listen on ipv6,\
nor is it particularly configurable, and it (when used on a guest lan)
can introduce security holes.

On the other hand, it could speed things up for many users.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-12T15:24:10" author="Dave Täht" >}}
I "improved" the defaults to

A\) Use the system DNS resolver always\
B) Set the CacheIsShared option\
C) use up 10MB by default\
D) Listen on ipv6\
E) Query on both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses, but prefer ipv4\
F) default to only allowing the default address/24 on the lan to access
the proxy

Polipo would be better if it talked to the internal resolver in a
threaded manner. I don't think it will be a win in this configuration
for larger numbers of users.

I've tested it as a ipv4 and ipv6 proxy doing ipv6/ipv4 &lt;-&gt;
ipv4/ipv6. There appears to be a firewall issue for pure ipv6 to ipv6
transfers via the proxy at present (this is ironic)

With these fixes in place polipo seems to function fairly well, however,
for a single user.

It will need hand configuration (via vi) for core lan changes, etc.
There is no web interface.

Tested right now on latest build, polipo works.

It works for ipv4 to ipv4 and ipv6 to ipv4 transfers. The ipv6 to ipv6
bug is an artifact of the currently borked ipv6 support.

It does require hand configuration of the file to account for a few
things and added features, which need to be documented on the wiki.

Apologies for the blast from the past, but I'm getting reading to close
Cape Town and want to make sure this doesn't need any more work. See my
question below:

Is this manual configuration information either in the wiki or built
into the package somehow?
