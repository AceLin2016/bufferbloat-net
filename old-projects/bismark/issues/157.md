{{< issue_description >}}
The busybox version of traceroute should support the generation of ICMP
packets, instead of UDP, using the option -I.\
For some strange reason using such option always generates UDP packets.

Such beahavior limitates the flexibility of the bismark-tr script,\
that should be able to choose between UDP, ICMP and TCP implemetations
of the algorithm.

For our purposes, it would be optimal to have only one traceroute binary
supporting all the three protocols.

There is another version of traceroute in the opkg repository.

Will the existing tcptraceroute there work for you?

opkg update\
opkg install tcptraceroute.

If not multiple other traceroute tools exist. Pick one...

lft The alternative traceroute and whois tools for network engineers\
mtr Full screen ncurses traceroute tool\
tcptraceroute A traceroute implementation using TCP packets.\
tcptraceroute6 A TCP/IPv6-based traceroute implementation

the LFT tool looks very promising as a more general purpose traceroute.

I will enable it in tonight's build.

you should be able to install and play with lft now, even on a router
that is not from the current build.

lft seems to work properly.

I'm going to convert the bismark-tr script to work with it.

is lft what you want to use? or tcptraceroute? I need to install one or
the other or both by default.

I confirm lft.\
Please include it.

The default build(s) of cerowrt and bismark 'atlanta' have lft as part
of the main image now. It seems to work well. we could use some more
documentation on how to use it properly, and how, exactly, it's used in
bismark, on the wiki, but I'm closing this bug regardless.
