good defaults are one thing.

A good standard procedure for doing installs is another.

Also need to note any known "gotchas" in the interfaces.

I have not done release notes as I lack feedback from the field.

Secondly, I have seen no updates to the default installation guide,
judging from some\
of the bugs I filed elsewhere like \#170, more stuff needs to be done to
fully configure these devices.
