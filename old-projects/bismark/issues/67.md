Would be nice to have some way of estimating wireless throughput inside
the home. This will require some experimentation, of course. But, we
have had a couple ideas on this (returning large DNS or ARP replies to
clients)

Tested out bing last weekend.

The OpenWRT build is quite noisy. Next step will be to compare bing to
iperf, etc.

I made some tests:\
- I modified arping (version 2.09) to send padded ARP requests. As I
expected such request can't be greater than the MTU size (at least using
the libnet framework). The resulting ARP replies are equivalent in size
to a void UDP packet. Generating 10000 arp requests over a 802.11g link
with excellent signal I wasn't able to obtain a router-to-host rate
bigger than 300Kbps.\
- Using bing on the same link estimates a 16Mbps rate.

I think we can follow this plan:\
- we can use bing as a first quick solution to estimate wireless
throughput\
- we can try to implement the same algorithm by using ARP instead of
ICMP echo (most Windows hosts are configured to drop pings by default).

arping is in the build...

as is bing...

script from here?

it is hard to tell when stuff is going over the wireless.

Stuff going over wireless DOES explicitly happen over the guest
networks, and as we have a REAL webserver, as well as rsync installed,
we can do something like mini speedtest by default - which,
unfortunately requires php right now. Doing it in ash would be best,
although python is available.

We could set it up something like speedtest.home.lan on the router
webserver.

It would be mildly better to have something that phoned home with the
results, tho.

AND IF THIS IS NOT NEEDED BY NEXT WEEK, please change the deadline to
suit.
