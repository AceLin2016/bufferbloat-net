{{< issue_description >}}
Bash costs probably several hundred k of flash that can be used for
other things,\
and the default busybox shell is not too horrible.

What bash specific features are required in the scripts?

If it is possible to convert, how long will it take?

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-04-06T04:28:39" author="Walter de Donato" >}}
Most scripts are already ash compilant (just need to change the header).

I remember that some of them needed some bash specific features,\
but I have to dig into them to remember which one.

I'll give you soon an estimated time.

How long will it take to port to ash?

The bismark-mgmt were ported without much problem; I will do the same
for bismark-active. They shouldn't need bash.

If so, please close this bug before release.

My assumption is no... but I don't want to assume this.

Please close this bug if bash is no longer required.
