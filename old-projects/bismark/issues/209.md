{{< issue_description >}}
There were 2 routers where both the radios didn't come up on the cerowrt
build; Joon's and Matt's. On mine, the 5G radio didn't come up.

On all three, the radios work perfectly on the capetown build after a
reflash.

I flashed the lastest build on matts router, which I'm told demonstrated
the problem.

Frankly I don't remember if I tried 2.4ghz. 5 worked
