DSL users especially, use PPP over ethernet. While available in the
package repository, it is not installed by default, and for a more
worldwide deployment, should be.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-06-13T21:19:06" author="Dave Täht" >}}
ppoe is now installed by default. But the gui didn't pick it up or I did
it wrong.

So I have ppoe support integral this build.

I really really wish I could remember the guy's name, in canada, who
reported this problem, tested the old solution, and got it working as an
external package. In particular my concern is that the reduced mtu ppoe
introduces (8 bytes less than normal) is not propigated to other
utilities, notably radvd and the ipv6 setup routines.

He participated in another bug here, he's registered on bufferbloat.net,
but so far, I can't find him or remember his name. I misremembered it
once, as 'vincent'... I think... he's been on irc...

This was fixed long ago.
