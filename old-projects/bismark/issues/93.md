{{< issue_description >}}
If you are using an existing build of bismark, 100% of cpu is being
eaten by mountd.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-04-19T07:17:02" author="Dave T채ht" >}}
Rather than figure out what was going wrong with mountd, I removed it as
a default package from the \~bismark/src/.config file, made it
installable as a module, and did a new build of bismark to suit. **You
will want to make mountd a modular rather than required package in your
.config for your builds as well!**

CONFIG\_PACKAGE\_mountd=m

You can remove the mountd package from your already built routers via:

opkg remove mountd

And/or add a\
killall mountd\
to your /etc/rc.local file

**IF** there is a need for mountd in the final configuration, this bug
will need to be further explored and fixed.
