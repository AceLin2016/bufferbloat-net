{{< issue_description >}}
The regulatory domain for the wireless interface is not set by default.
This (I think) prevents wireless-n from working properly.

You can set your country code by setting "option 'country' 'US' for your
wireless0 and 1 interfaces in /etc/config/wireless.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-04-21T04:08:33" author="Dave Täht" >}}
The latest build has the ability for users to set regulatory domains.

Please test 'US' and at least one other domain.

In order to be able to comply with worldwide wireless standards, country
specific regulatory domains need to be able to be set.

Earlier in this bug documents how to change that in the conf file.

You can also easily get and set the regulatory domain via the iw
command.

iw get reg\
iw set reg

(I'm also trying to work out workflow issues on this bug in the hope
that explicitly "throwing responsibility over the wall" works. Feel free
to reassign/delegate.)

The lastest build (april 20) on huchra should allow full regulatory
change support.

I think this works now in the latest image update. I tested this out and
it seems to work fine.
