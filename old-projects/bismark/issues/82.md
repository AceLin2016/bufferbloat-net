A fix to a ECN/pfifo qdisc bug is in 2.6.39-rcX. It has not been
backported to openwrt as yet.

At the moment the wndr3700 is using the pfifo qdisc on most (all?)
interfaces. I do not know if this will remain the case, but the bug
messes up ecn enabled flows to a large extent. Nor do I know what qdisc
was used in the original study.

More details on the problem and tiny fix are here:

This should drop right into 2.6.37.6 too with the right work in
openwrt...

Subject: net\_sched: fix ip\_tos2prio

From: Dan Siemon<dan@coverfire.com>

\[ Upstream commit 4a2b9c3756077c05dd8666e458a751d2248b61b6 \]

ECN support incorrectly maps ECN BESTEFFORT packets to TC\_PRIO\_FILLER\
(1) instead of TC\_PRIO\_BESTEFFORT (0)

This means ECN enabled flows are placed in pfifo\_fast/prio low
priority\
band, giving ECN enabled flows \[ECT (0) and CE codepoints\] higher
drop\
probabilities.

This is rather unfortunate, given we would like ECN being more widely\
used.

I'd frozen openwrt april 5, and moved on to getting where we could test
a bunch of routers.

That meant leaving the kernel and packaging system alone, and trying to
get people focused on creating the needed packages (as well as testing
and familiarizing themselves with the routers)

Felix just pushed the fix for this bug \#82 into openwrt head (thx
felix!)

There are a few more kernel patches that are going to land in the next
week or so, and then it would be possible to freeze the kernel, update
the packages, and catch up to openwrt head again, and do another round
of group testing.

In the meantime, if anyone would care to test, I did a separate build of
my own of the bismark stuff from openwrt head, it's at:

http://huchra.bufferbloat.net/~d/cerowrt

And it's certainly possible for others to do so from their own private
builds.

I pulled git head and package head from openwrt last night (which\
includes the pfifo\_fast fix) into bismark:src/wndr3700 ...

and did a new build on huchra.

I note that if you have a conversation of relevance to the bug tracker,\
you can cc George Burdell with the ticket number it is on and he'll\
update the database. On a good day, he'll even update the status for
you\
as per the keywords here: http://www.redmine.org/boards/2/topics/18568
