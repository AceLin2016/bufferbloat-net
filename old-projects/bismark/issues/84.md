{{< issue_description >}}
As SFB is a leading candidate for a qdisc that can help manage bloat, it
would be nice to have it available as a kernel package, along with the
acommpanying tc (which also has CHOKe support) A version backported to
2.6.38 is described at:

https://lists.bufferbloat.net/pipermail/bloat/2011-April/000384.html

Regrettably the current wndr build is against 2.6.37.6

Whenever we move forward to 2.6.38 or can backport to 2.6.37 it would be
good to have this under consideration.

## History

However, the tc utility has not been updated to suit and it is thus,
hard to configure.
