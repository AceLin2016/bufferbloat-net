&gt; Does anyone know how to get GNU time 1.7? The current version of

General tip: when trying to figure out where a utility comes from, you
can generally do a:

\$ dpkg --search /usr/bin/time\
time: /usr/bin/time

Which in this case shows that ubuntu/debian time comes from the time
package.

You can then

\$ mkdir \~/src/time; cd \$\_; apt-get source time

to see more about that package and its source.

Anyway...

The version of time in the build is the busybox version, which as you've
noted is quite limited. It would be a good idea to go through the
busybox configuration screen and figure out what additional features are
needed, and what can be dropped. (be gentle here)

In this case, if you really need gnu time, it would be best to add gnu
time as an openwrt package,\
and then drop the applet from the busybox build after it works.
Regrettably it is not already packaged up in openwrt.

Alternatively, the busybox folk are good on accepting patches, so you
could modify busybox to support the syntax for time that you need. As
src goes, busybox is VERY modular and easy to deal with.

Either way, note this problem in the wiki's issues page. I can see how
lacking a good timing utility would be a big problem!

## History

I've captured the issue in the bug database.

Could you document the syntax of time you require?

I tossed of a quick port of the gnu time utility to the wndr3700, but\
lack the hardware to try it.

get the test binary from:

http://www.teklibre.com/~d/cerowrt/time

and let me know if it works. (you will want to remove the existing\
"time" symlink on your router if it does). Make sure it's measuring\
accurate time...

Secondly, I started at a shared openwrt repository for some new\
packages. github doesn't need any IT resources, and is free for open\
source users, so I used their service.

See https://github.com/dtaht/ceropackages for details

You can do a read-only checkout via

git clone git://github.com/dtaht/ceropackages.git

If you want read/write access, create and/or let me know your account
on\
github

You can add the above to your package feeds by editing feeds.conf
adding\
this line

src-git cerowrt git://github.com/dtaht/ceropackages.git

then doing a ./scripts/feeds update

I tossed gnu time in there, but it is not fully baked yet, although I\
did a patch to make it compile manually, I didn't figure out how to do\
that right for openwrt. see commit log and Makefile for details.

You can add gnu time to (and break) your existing build by:

./scripts/feeds install time\
make menuconfig \# add gnu time as a module\
make

I'm kind of hoping that having shown this example, someone else will\
take it through the last step of making it into a working package! :)

I just quickly tested it. It seems to be what we want, and also seems to
work. Will test it properly with the script and update.

Thanks for the quick response. Was meaning to get back on the syntax
email but got tied up with other stuff.

Anything to avoid finishing my taxes.

Well, I'll argue that making busybox's time command more complete would\
be a better option, so\
knowing the syntax you need for "time" on this bug report would be good.

But my goal at the moment is to quickly prototype as many of the core\
requirements as possible,\
so we know what needs to be done and fixed, and I figure you have a\
major dependency on accurate time.

Thanks. This is cool!

Srikanth: Let me know when (and how) you'd like me to update my openwrt
image. I'm very happy to be your active and passive measurement
tester/guinea pig for a home deployment.

So can someone sign up to make gnu time a package? I got as far as I
could that day, and this looked straightforward.

This took a lot more time than expected. GNU time is ANCIENT.

have to regenerate a new version of capetown, perhaps, from scratch.
