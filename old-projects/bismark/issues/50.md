D-ITG will need to be updated in the field
{{< /issue_journal >}}

Documentation needs to be updated as well.

is it stable/usable enough to embed in the image?
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-08T17:54:14" author="Brian Poole" >}}
We are already embedding D-ITG in the image (bismark-active has a
dependency to it.) We are running the latest version available which is
admittedly a beta.

Walter, any clue as to whether that is stable or if we need to roll a
custom package for an older (non-beta) version?
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-10T02:35:30" author="Walter de Donato" >}}
Also if the 2.7.0-Beta2 is not a stable, older stable versions may be
worst,\
because we solved some severe bugs in it.\
The best choice would be to use the 2.8.0 version which we are going to
release soon,\
but I don't know if not having yet the package publicly available
represents a problem.

As a conclusion, because we are short in time, I think we can freeze
D-ITG at version 2.7.0-Beta2.
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-12T18:44:58" author="Dave Täht" >}}
It must not be a dependency that works.

When installed manually

opkg install ditg

Pulls in a bunch of files.

I have no idea how to test whether it works or not. IF it works, I'll
bake it into the build.

Please test or document HOW to test.
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-12T19:17:13" author="Dave Täht" >}}
I will put the underlying libs for D-ITG in the build, so as not to
impact flash as much.

We HAVE finally exceeded 8MB however, sadly enough. We were still able
to support the wndr3700v1 until a few days ago... Sigh.

Still, please confirm that it works via opkg install and testing
(documentation on the wiki would be nice) and I'll slam the whole thing
in the build.
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-13T04:33:10" author="Walter de Donato" >}}
Since the ditg\_2.7.0-Beta2\_ar71xx.ipk package contains some not-needed
components,\
we can recover some space if we decide to put a customized package on
the huchra repository.

Anyway, I can add instructions to test it on the wiki (just for the use
we need it for).\
We have a test script, but it requires a lot of storage space to work.
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-17T06:36:48" author="Walter de Donato" >}}
We (me, Antonio and other D-ITG authors) decided to release the
2.8.0-rc1 version in days.\
Then, since our measurements need some features not available in 2.7.0
version,\
the next step is just to update the OpenWrt package Makefile to point to
the new version URL.\
Such version has already been extensively tested and can be considered a
stable.
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-18T14:39:03" author="Dave Täht" >}}
The problem is that this gets baked into the image, so changing it in
the field requires wasting flash, AND doing a new build of the package,
and a full associated (roughly 2 day) QA round of the router, and
potentially having two versions of this tool in the field will lead to
problems in the data.

I'll have to bake the existing tool into todays image. I did not intend
to have to do more QA at this level at this late date, and would prefer
to slip the date of the "final" image to whenever this lands move the
associated QA to that.

Do you have a target date for the next version?

What will the upgrade change/break?
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-22T07:06:19" author="Dave Täht" >}}
I'm closing this bug. If you need to put a new release in the field, an
existing packager will have to package, test, and deploy.

QA is effectively complete at this point, on this release, and no new
packages should be added until there are weeks of feedback from the
field.
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-22T08:53:00" author="Walter de Donato" >}}
Damn! Too late :|

We have the new version ready here:
http://www.grid.unina.it/software/ITG/codice/D-ITG-2.8.0-rc1.tgz
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-22T21:02:34" author="Dave Täht" >}}
If and **only if** continued use of the previous release of dit-g will
cause a router to catch fire, emit smoke and radiation of beyond
Chernobyl's levels, killing thousands of people, and, further, also
cause another republican to become president of the USA, and start
another war in the middle east...

... am I willing to incorporate a revised package into the capetown
build at this point.

I also would prefer that initial testing of your spanking new release
occurs on systems that have more than 4MB of flash left to spare.

However:

I am perfectly willing to incorporate this latest version of dit-g into
the upcoming releases of the iscwrt or wisp6 projects so long as someone
else is willing to package it and test it.

After testing in there, it can be shipped as an update to capetown, or
capetown can have another release.

And ultimately... get it merged up to openwrt, where my release
schedules will fail to matter.

Does this work for you?
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-23T02:48:36" author="Walter de Donato" >}}
Ok, no radiation of beyond Chernobyl's levels and stuff like that...\
...just because D-ITG is currently disabled in bismark active scripts.

2.7.0 release just won't work, which means no JITTER and PACKET LOSS
measures.

The decision it's up to you...
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-23T05:41:03" author="Dave Täht" >}}
So why did I just WASTE flash by shipping it at all?

Sigh.
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-23T05:43:03" author="Nick Feamster" >}}
Wait, why are we not using D-ITG? It seems to provide some useful
measurements. I agree, if it is in the build, it would be nice to use
it!
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-23T07:03:16" author="Dave Täht" >}}
So this appears to have been a series of misunderstandings, compounded
by the immediacy of the deadline, and my lack of knowledge of the guts
of the bismark and d-itg packages.

I thought that this package was being tested. I thought that it worked,
at least minimally.

It sounds like the correct procedure would have been to have created a
bismark-ditg package which contained and required ditg with the related
c++ library, and it should not have been baked into the build by
default.

Please note that incorporating this package as it stands made it
impossible to support the wndr3700v1 with capetown, and also made it
impossible to support alternative routers with 8MB of flash, which is
most of them.

There were other tools that could have been chosen instead, as well,
from a rather large list.

Is dit-g being used for anything within bismark at this point?
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-23T07:07:14" author="Srikanth Sundaresan" >}}
D-ITG is used by bismark-active for packet loss and jitter tests.

"As a conclusion, because we are short in time, I think we can freeze
D-ITG at version 2.7.0-Beta2."

which contradicts:

"2.7.0 release just won't work, which means no JITTER and PACKET LOSS
measures."

And conflates:

"D-ITG is used by bismark-active for packet loss and jitter tests."

Are you telling me bismark-active - AS SHIPPED - is enabled and using an
unusable version of ditg?
{{< /issue_journal >}}
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-23T09:37:55" author="Nick Feamster" >}}
Yes, would be nice to clear this up! :-)

Sorry about the unconsistencies.\
We always used a newer unreleased version of ditg on previous
deployments.\
My fault was in not checking that version in advance on the current
build. I\
did forget about two features strictly necessary to let it work
correctly in\
our context.

I've probably been not clear about this point when I detected it.

A point I'm not understanding is: did we loose the possibility to update
the\
devices in the field? what happens if we do "opkg update" on
bismark-active?

Shouldn't we support such feature?\
Which is the drawback of doing that instead of building it directly into
the\
image?

Sorry again,\
-Walter\

Just ported the latest version of D-ITG to uclibcxx.\
I added it to the bismark-packages feed on github.

It now requires 334KB (binaries) + 189KB (uclibcxx). \[stripped\]

After pulling the latest head while prepping for the cerowrt rc7 series,
I get the following error when trying to build ditg.
