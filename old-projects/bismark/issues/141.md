Currently the bismark chrome package consists of some links. It would be
nice if it did more than that, and the links were worthwhile, AND it
pointed to networkdashboard AND the router's configure interface.

If people could suggest deep links (google's funding office, this
projects' main page, the Italian site, etc) AND images, it would be
great.

I think we have a version that's now acceptable for the first release.
We also have projectbismark.net.
