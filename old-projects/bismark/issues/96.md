With the latest image, upon re-flashing, the initial telnet into the box
(192.168.42.1) does not work. Error is "connection refused", so the port
does not appear to be open.

% telnet 192.168.42.1\
Trying 192.168.42.1...\
telnet: connect to address 192.168.42.1: Connection refused\
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host

Ping works, and the Web interface is reachable (from where the user can
initially set a default ssh/web admin password, but the telnet issue
should be fixed.

Srikanth thinks that this is possibly an OpenWRT bug. Dave?

The core word here appears to be "reflashing".

Are you flashing with the factory or sysupgrade image?

I would hope that with the factory image the system would revert to\
having telnet.

With a sysupgrade image I would hope that the passwords and ip
addresses\
would remain\
the same.

What you describe appears to be in the middle?

I had the telnet issue both on an initial flash (with the image from 2
nights ago) and with the sysupgrade (which I performed last night).

The sysupgrade did reset the password.

The default behavior seems to be to require a reboot after a reflash for
ssh to work right, and to update the password from the web interface to
make ssh work as well.

Please verify this is the procedure required.

Telnet is no longer an option. Removed the telnet option from the
documentation on wiki.
