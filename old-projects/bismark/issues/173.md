Since the current post-babel config doesn't really work for me, I'll
reflash with the latest build.

Latest build works just fine. Clifton and seapoint are both back up and
running. Srikanth is testing some things out now on these boxes.

sorry I was not around.

lacking the ip route information I asked for, I don't know what went

and not having promised to actually deliver this functionality in the
first place,\
(aside from the now demonstrated actual market need)

I am not going to deploy this before it is ready, which I hope will be
part of the next release\
of wisp6, at which point the packages can be upgraded on bismark.

It can certainly be made to work with co-operation from the field, but
is far from easy or automatic at present.
