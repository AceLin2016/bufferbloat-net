DEVICE\_ID=\$(cat /etc/bismark/ID)\
PLATFORM=\$(uname -nm | tr ' ' '\_')\
VERSION=340\
ZONE=NorthAm\
WAN\_IF=eth1\
WIFI\_IF=wlan0

Does this need to be reset for South Africa?

## History

We defined the ZONE to let the Management Server\
assign to devices Measurement Servers\
preferably located in the same Zone.

For South Africa such parameter should be set to "SouthAf".

I think we are now planning to do the assignment to measurement server
using DNS. So, do we still need "ZONE"?

We currently assign a measure to a specific measurement server taking
care of avoiding the overlap of different HEAVY measures towards it.\
A device just before starting a measure asks the server for the Mserver
IP address and measure-specific options (like port-number). The
management server selects the less-busy measurement server depending on
previous requests.\
The reply received by the device, apart from the server IP and options,
also gives the amount of time to wait before starting the measure.\
This way we can balance the load and control, for each measurement
server, how many measurements are done concurrently toward it, thus
avoiding results affected by interferences.\
The ZONE parameter just tells the server to select among a subset of
servers depending on the location.

If we move to DNS-based assignment we loose such control.

A compatible solution could be to let the device obtain the IP from the
DNS query\
and then request to the server a time interval to perform the measure
towards it.\
This requires modifications to the client/server protocol.

Why does zone not use ISO standard country codes? There's a reference
for that baked into the web interface for the worldwide regulatory
spectrum already in /usr/lib/countrycodes.lst

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_3166-1_alpha-2

A fairly normal means of dealing with this is you create DNS subdomains
based on countrycode,\
e.g. measurement.it.projectbismark.net, or
measurement.us.projectbismark.net, and you use GEOIP for
measurement.projectbismark.net to attempt a best guess.

Having fine grained control actually in the file itself is ok, but the
file needs to be configured properly on a per router basis in that case,
and that seems unlikely.

Related to this, is somehow KNOWING that j.random router somewhere in
the world, is actually reporting accurate time, in UTC, so measurements
can be correlated.
