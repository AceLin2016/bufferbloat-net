It acquires no IP addresses, nor does it assign any.

It does come up with a SSID on the wireless interface, so the problem is
in network initialization.

The flashing technique was no fun either.

we so far as I know haven't promised these to anybody, and the brick on
my hands refuses to respond even to tftp.

I would prefer all our eggs to be in multiple baskets, but until the
reason for bricking is well understood (which may take jtag to resolve),
risking the other one of these on the project is not a good idea. If we
had several, and time...

If someone would like to take on making the buffalo router work at this
point, great. Otherwise, we lack time to pursue this further at this
point.

Nick: If you still care about the buffalo router, send me the bricked
one...
