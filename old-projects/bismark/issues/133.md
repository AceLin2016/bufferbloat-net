Although the qdisc claims red is using ECN, tc does not report ECN
marking ever being applied, even if I ratchet down the bandwidth well
below what is real (10kbit, 100kbit, 5Mbit tested)

I will still argue that tuning red properly to assert ECN is a black
art, and that the qos-scripts could use some love. However that is a
bigger project than I can take on right now, and they seem to work
fairly well as is.
