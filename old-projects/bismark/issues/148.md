Babel interfaces come up automatically. Do we need them?

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-05-15T19:15:42" author="Dave Täht" >}}
In the case of a working mesh node somewhere, babel enables connectivity
to the internet even when the main link is down.

You are visiting the offices of the mesh potato. I personally had an
interest in showing off this feature to them, but it is not required for
your own deployment.

It is, however, required so I can get to the office from the lab, and
vice versa, at present.

Can't change this layer of the build at this point. Noted in the release
notes.
