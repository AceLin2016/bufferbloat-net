We don't need the guest interfaces IMO. It makes the interface very
complex.

## History

Guest interfaces are a feature of the original firmware that I
duplicated in this design.

It would be good if there was a way to disable them by default, but the
three underlying ways to do so all have problems.

1\) Disable the radios. This of course has the side effect of disabling
the private interfaces as well.

2\) Delete the guest interface. This blows up the firewall and QoS rules
were a guest network were to be created again.

3\) Don't have guest interfaces. This has the same problem as 2, in the
case of a guest interface, getting working firewall AND QoS rules is
tricky in the first place.

I would prefer to deploy this feature and see how actual users deal with
it.

I tend to agree with Srikanth here. The interface was pretty difficult
to understand.

I would prefer feedback from the field on this feature. Nor can I fix
this layer of the build without breaking firewall rules left and right.

Noted in the release notes and installation guide.
