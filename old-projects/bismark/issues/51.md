I believe progress was made on this by Dave some time ago. Can we close
it? (or update and move into the next release?)

So far as I know what I'd done got deployed by srikanth. Sri?

Which is not what I'd intended, the web design and reporting system
needed to be fleshed out first, in order for the db to meet the
reporting and web requirements.

Notably, django needed to be dropped in favor of a toolkit that
supported schemas and views - I suggested 3 - for the database to be
fast and clean, scaleable, and replicatable.
