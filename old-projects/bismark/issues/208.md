Networking in the latest cerowrt build (the one that we used for the
smoke test today afternoon/evening) doesn't seem to work out of the box
(I'm testing from home, with the upstream device being a wndr with
capetown). The device gets an IP from the upstream box; but can't ping
the upstream router, or anything beyond. Here's the routing table:

root@OpenWrt:\~\# route\
Kernel IP routing table\
Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface\
default 192.168.42.1 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 ge00\
172.30.42.32 \* 255.255.255.224 U 0 0 0 se00\

192.168.42.0/24 dev ge00 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.42.126

However, after restarting networking, it works. There are a few errors
that pop up during restart, though.

bind: Address already in use\
could not bind to udp port 123\
command failed: No such device (-19)

And plenty of iptables errors:

iptables: No chain/target/match by that name.\
ip6tables: No chain/target/match by that name

The routing entries look like this:\
root@OpenWrt:\~\# route\
Kernel IP routing table\

It's weird; I don't understand this. The first table seems proper
(though should the default entry be at the bottom?). There seem t be
errors in the second, but routing works.

Hopefully this and \#209 were related. The iptables thing is an open
question and I don't know what the errors you got where.

I restarted the firewall and got no errors at all from iptables.
