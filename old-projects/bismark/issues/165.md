{{< issue_description >}}
there is **no** point in doing version control on everything and then
just dumping something critical like your actual data measurement tools
into a package arbitrarily.

GIGO.

do a svn tag of a version number\
create a tarball of the release from that version number\
create a package from the tarball\
build it\
test...

It's the only way to avoid GIGO.

How did the scripts get into git this time? Is there a svn tag or
release number they are tied to?
