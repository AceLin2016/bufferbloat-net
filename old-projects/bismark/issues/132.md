{{< issue_description >}}
The default firewall rules did not work on the default wlan.

Did work on the guest network and on the wired interface.

I have a new set of firewall rules that do work, however they rely on a
change to the initial setup in the wifi utility that is not baked yet.

you should not be able to access machines (except via ping) from the
guest to the private network now.

If you can set up a machine on the guest network and a machine on the
private network, see if you can get through from private to guest, but
not from guest to private

from private to guest - works, from guest to private doesn't. This is
correct.
