Please create a virtual web server and rsync-able site for:

capetown.yourcooldomainwhateveritiscalled.com to serve as the long term
opkg database.

As the url is baked into the image, it needs to be correct AND it would
help if it was up soon, like, by monday afternoon.

I can supply an rsync.conf for the server.

the package database is now in the right place. opkg works.

Without real DNS support, I can do no more.
