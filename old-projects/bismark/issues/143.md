As best as I can tell from looking at the current firewalling code, a
"zone" can consist of multiple "interfaces". Xwrt wants one interface
per "zone".

This results are tricky to understand, as we have a private and guest
zone, consisting of many interfaces each.

Firewalling thus far has been difficult, and ipv6 firewalling works not
at all.

So it would be nice if zones could be of multiple interfaces, assuming
I'm understanding the rules right.

the new web interface 'luci' does the right thing with firewall rules.

the underlying firewall rules still need to be revised (simplified) to
work with luci correctly, however.

there is already a related bug re the firewall rules, so I can close
this one.
