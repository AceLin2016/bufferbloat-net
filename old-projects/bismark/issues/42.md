Device identifier should be the mac address

On the server side we need to make a lot of changes to manage this side
of configuration

Separate database (postgres database) -

One measurement table has 6 months of data with zillions of entries.

Are we still going to have any registration steps? The box's ID is now
being generated automatically on start of bismark the first time based
on MAC.

We'd need geolocation information in some way.\
For now we can rely on server-side IP-to-Location associations (very bad
accuracy).

In the future we should provide a way to let the user give us such
information.\
The proposal is to intercept the first HTTP request (like a captive
portal)\
and let the user submit a web form.\
The web form could be part of the OpenWRT interface or directly a page
on the management server.
