{{< issue_description >}}
While working with eric on getting his wndr3700 working, the web based
backup script failed to work entirely.

Also, mountd was eating 100% of CPU.

Could someone verify this is still a problem?

I confirm that this utility does not work at present.

I removed mountd from the build as a workaround (7ish days ago)

IF mountd is required it is being built as a module and should be looked
into on a new bug.

But backups do not work as of my last test...

I've disabled mountd entirely but web based backups using xWrt still
fail.

The uhttpd web daemon does not handle more than one request at a time,
and was sleeping while waiting for the file to download, thus blocking
the file download.

The fix is now in xWrt head and in the current capetown build

Thx Travis!
