Where is this machine?

from bismark.conf:

1.  Bismark Proxy Server\
    PROXY=143.215.131.173\
    PROXY\_PORT=123

Should this be a DNS address?

Seems this should be a DNS address, yep.

I think we need to install BIND on dp4 and get the DNS transferred over
so that we can do GeoIP-based redirection.

Is the fixed ip address for 'PROXY' here fixed?

I don't care if this is fixed today. In fact if it isn't fixed, don't
tell me you haven't fixed it yet and slip a fix in next week, when I'm
not looking.

I know I can find this in the code in 2 seconds, but finding this
problem still in there would be bad for my blood pressure.

When or if it is fixed, close the bug. NO PRIO 1 or 2s please.

We feel more comfortable to let it as is for now.\
It gives us a fixed recovery point we can trust on also if\
the DNS fails permanently.

We'll work on a better multi-management-server algorythm for the next
release.

OK, thank you for the update.

You do realize that this ties you to dp4 - the server with a load
average of 4, currently, on the wrong lan, for a long time?

Do you mean the 'next release' or the 'next release candidate'?

If you must use a fixed ip address, rather than dns, please ask your IT
dept about the possibility of using 'anycast' in the future. Anycast is
probably a better solution than DNS is, actually.

PROXY points to porter-square and not to dp4.\
Anyway anycast would be certainly the best solution.

I meant the next release, but if we are able to obtain the anycast
address in time,\
we can do it for the next release candidate.

going anycast eventually, or preferably soon, works for me either way.

thank you for correcting me as to where it pointed. How is the load
average on that server, where is it, what is it, and what else does it
do?

It isn't probably the best server to use for that, because it is the
measurement server at Gatech,\
but it is needed only occasionally for that purpose.

I just used it because it's the only server at Gatech where I have the
permissions to set iptables rules...

Here is a fresh top:\
top - 16:37:38 up 21 days, 1:35, 2 users, load average: 0.00, 0.00,
0.00\
Tasks: 87 total, 1 running, 86 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie\
Cpu(s): 0.0%us, 0.0%sy, 0.0%ni,100.0%id, 0.0%wa, 0.0%hi, 0.0%si, 0.0%st\
Mem: 3374608k total, 535952k used, 2838656k free, 229872k buffers\

I'm happy with that load average. I worry about dp4, however. A lot.

If you need anther server to point, to, let me know and we can set you
up with permissions.
