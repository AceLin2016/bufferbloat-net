{{< issue_description >}}
By default it is picking up the 127.0.0.1 address on boot, and NOT the
dhcp supplied address.

If you manually create the /etc/resolv.conf. KILL -9 the dnsmasq
process. Then start it manually with the same command line, it works.

## History
{{< issue_journal date="2011-04-06T15:58:45" author="Dave T채ht" >}}
dnsmasq uses /tmp/resolv.conf.auto

rather than /tmp/resolv.conf

/tmp/resolv.conf.auto should be created on boot when it acquires a dhcp
address from the server.

"Fixed" by changing /etc/config/dhcp to look at resolv.conf rather than
resolv.conf.auto but this needs to be looked at harder.

(at least it boots to doing the right thing now)

Fixed by installing the firewall as a core package and setting up DNS
right.
