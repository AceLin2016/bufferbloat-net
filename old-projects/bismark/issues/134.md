I think the web interface once upon a time (like, last saturday)\
actually let you edit the radio's channel....

now there is no option to set the channel displayed.

If the channel is not in the wireless file, it is not displayed in the
web interface to be changed. I would argue that it should always be
displayed and if not in the config file, pulled from iw.

For us, I have changed the wifi creation shell script to put in the
channel by default.

And for all I know it was there, and I was just going blind. That said,
I needed to change the default channel in the script anyway.
