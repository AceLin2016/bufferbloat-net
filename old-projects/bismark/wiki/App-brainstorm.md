Application Brainstorm
======================

Different types of users: home users and researchers.

Toolkit for building applications? Could have a router platform for
allowing other users to develop without knowledge of or access to the
low-level Apis, similar to how people develop applications for iPhone.

Seattle, Scriptroute, etc. Compare to the POX design.

First step could be to start with a limited problem domain and design
the API around it.

Privacy of data collected. Guarantee privacy of collected information
with information flow control.

Control: home automation. Does an openwrt router support zwave or any
home automation type thing? Could couple with home automation? Use
network router to track human activity and then couple with a control
system.

Take Keith's findings about what network features are useful for
determining human behavior and then use that as a basis for an API.

Two parts to the API: monitoring and control. What kind of questions to
ask for each type?

Is it worth doing a survey to figure out the types of things people
would like to know from their home network, and the types of things they
would like to control. Conduct a broader survey?

Would certain types of queries impose storage requirements?

Version control for router configurations. Provide for the users in the
cloud. Configuration management for home networks?

USB stick for extra storage. Caching for updates. Caching for improving
performance of different applications.

Simultaneous high bandwidth downloads introducing interference? Time
shifting big downloads?

What to cache? Advantages to caching on the gateway versus caching on
the browser?

What problems will go away? Latency is pretty fundamental but doesn't
apply to all applications. Throughout may be a longer-term issue.

Questions for netgear?

Diagnostic tool for the web interface to let users run an instant
diagnostic

1\. End users:

2\. Researchers:\
Building better tools\
Creating interfaces\
Using the platform as a tool to monitor human behavior
