Why 42?
=======

No reason in particular, apart from the fact that it's unlikely to
conflict with upstream NATs and other routers normally configured on the
192.168.1. and 192.168.0. addresses.

It's also the answer to [Life, the Universe, and
Everything](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life.2C_the_Universe.2C_and_Everything_.2842.29)

What was the question?
