OpenWRT build for the wndr3700v2
================================

Presently the prototypes are being built on
http://huchra.bufferbloat.net/wndr3700

Please send a ssh key to bismark-admins if you wish to access the build
system directly.

(this will become simpler in the future AND the build server will move)

If you wish to do your own builds, see:

<link>Setting up an OpenWRT Toolchain</link> or <link>Setting up a
wndr3700 Toolchain at home</link>
