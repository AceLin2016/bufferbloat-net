Thank you all for your enthusiasm for the Kermit project. We're working
on a distributable version of Kermit that will tie into network
dashboard. For now, we cannot commit to a firm timeline for events,
suffice to say we're working on it but we'll keep this page as current
as we can.

Check this page for news about the project as it unfolds. If you're
interested in working on the project as a student at Georgia Tech,
please get in touch with me directly.
